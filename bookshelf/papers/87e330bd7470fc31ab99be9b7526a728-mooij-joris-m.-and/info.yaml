abstract: We show how, and under which conditions, the equilibrium states of a first-order
  Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) system can be described with a deterministic
  Structural Causal Model (SCM). Our exposition sheds more light on the concept of
  causality as expressed within the framework of Structural Causal Models, especially
  for cyclic models.
