abstract: While advances in computing resources have made processing enormous amounts
  of data possible, human ability to identify patterns in such data has not scaled
  accordingly. Efficient computational methods for condensing and simplifying data
  are thus becoming vital for extracting actionable insights. In particular, while
  data summarization techniques have been studied extensively, only recently has summarizing
  interconnected data, or graphs, become popular. This survey is a structured, comprehensive
  overview of the state-of-the-art methods for summarizing graph data. We first broach
  the motivation behind, and the challenges of, graph summarization. We then categorize
  summarization approaches by the type of graphs taken as input and further organize
  each category by core methodology. Finally, we discuss applications of summarization
  on real-world graphs and conclude by describing some open problems in the field.
