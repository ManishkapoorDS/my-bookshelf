abstract: Descriptional complexity is the study of the conciseness of the various
  models representing formal languages. The state complexity of a regular language
  is the size, measured by the number of states of the smallest, either deterministic
  or nondeterministic, finite automaton that recognises it. Operational state complexity
  is the study of the state complexity of operations over languages. In this survey,
  we review the state complexities of individual regularity preserving language operations
  on regular and some subregular languages. Then we revisit the state complexities
  of the combination of individual operations. We also review methods of estimation
  and approximation of state complexity of more complex combined operations.
