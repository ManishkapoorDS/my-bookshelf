abstract: Recent work in deep reinforcement learning (RL) has produced algorithms
  capable of mastering challenging games such as Go, chess, or shogi. In these works
  the RL agent directly observes the natural state of the game and controls that state
  directly with its actions. However, when humans play such games, they do not just
  reason about the moves but also interact with their physical environment. They understand
  the state of the game by looking at the physical board in front of them and modify
  it by manipulating pieces using touch and fine-grained motor control. Mastering
  complicated physical systems with abstract goals is a central challenge for artificial
  intelligence, but it remains out of reach for existing RL algorithms. To encourage
  progress towards this goal we introduce a set of physically embedded planning problems
  and make them publicly available. We embed challenging symbolic tasks (Sokoban,
  tic-tac-toe, and Go) in a physics engine to produce a set of tasks that require
  perception, reasoning, and motor control over long time horizons. Although existing
  RL algorithms can tackle the symbolic versions of these tasks, we find that they
  struggle to master even the simplest of their physically embedded counterparts.
  As a first step towards characterizing the space of solution to these tasks, we
  introduce a strong baseline that uses a pre-trained expert game player to provide
  hints in the abstract space to an RL agent's policy while training it on the full
  sensorimotor control task. The resulting agent solves many of the tasks, underlining
  the need for methods that bridge the gap between abstract planning and embodied
  control.
