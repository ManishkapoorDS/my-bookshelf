abstract: 'Decision theory formally solves the problem of rational agents in

  uncertain worlds if the true environmental probability

  distribution is known. Solomonoff''s theory of universal induction

  formally solves the problem of sequence prediction for unknown

  distribution. We unify both theories and give strong arguments

  that the resulting universal AIXI model behaves optimal in any

  computable environment. The major drawback of the AIXI model is

  that it is uncomputable. To overcome this problem, we construct a

  modified algorithm AIXI^tl, which is still superior to any

  other time t and space l bounded agent. The computation time

  of AIXI^tl is of the order t x 2^l.'
