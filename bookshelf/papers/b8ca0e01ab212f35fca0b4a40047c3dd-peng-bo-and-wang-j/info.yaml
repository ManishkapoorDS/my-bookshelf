abstract: Recent researches show that machine learning has the potential to learn
  better heuristics than the one designed by human for solving combinatorial optimization
  problems. The deep neural network is used to characterize the input instance for
  constructing a feasible solution incrementally. Recently, an attention model is
  proposed to solve routing problems. In this model, the state of an instance is represented
  by node features that are fixed over time. However, the fact is, the state of an
  instance is changed according to the decision that the model made at different construction
  steps, and the node features should be updated correspondingly. Therefore, this
  paper presents a dynamic attention model with dynamic encoder-decoder architecture,
  which enables the model to explore node features dynamically and exploit hidden
  structure information effectively at different construction steps. This paper focuses
  on a challenging NP-hard problem, vehicle routing problem. The experiments indicate
  that our model outperforms the previous methods and also shows a good generalization
  performance.
