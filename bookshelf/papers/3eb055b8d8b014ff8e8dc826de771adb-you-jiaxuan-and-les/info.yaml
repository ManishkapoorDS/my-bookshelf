abstract: 'Neural networks are often represented as graphs of connections between
  neurons. However, despite their wide use, there is currently little understanding
  of the relationship between the graph structure of the neural network and its predictive
  performance. Here we systematically investigate how does the graph structure of
  neural networks affect their predictive performance. To this end, we develop a novel
  graph-based representation of neural networks called relational graph, where layers
  of neural network computation correspond to rounds of message exchange along the
  graph structure. Using this representation we show that: (1) a "sweet spot" of relational
  graphs leads to neural networks with significantly improved predictive performance;
  (2) neural network''s performance is approximately a smooth function of the clustering
  coefficient and average path length of its relational graph; (3) our findings are
  consistent across many different tasks and datasets; (4) the sweet spot can be identified
  efficiently; (5) top-performing neural networks have graph structure surprisingly
  similar to those of real biological neural networks. Our work opens new directions
  for the design of neural architectures and the understanding on neural networks
  in general.'
