abstract: Machine learning is the science of discovering statistical dependencies
  in data, and the use of those dependencies to perform predictions. During the last
  decade, machine learning has made spectacular progress, surpassing human performance
  in complex tasks such as object recognition, car driving, and computer gaming. However,
  the central role of prediction in machine learning avoids progress towards general-purpose
  artificial intelligence. As one way forward, we argue that causal inference is a
  fundamental component of human intelligence, yet ignored by learning algorithms.   Causal
  inference is the problem of uncovering the cause-effect relationships between the
  variables of a data generating system. Causal structures provide understanding about
  how these systems behave under changing, unseen environments. In turn, knowledge
  about these causal dynamics allows to answer "what if" questions, describing the
  potential responses of the system under hypothetical manipulations and interventions.
  Thus, understanding cause and effect is one step from machine learning towards machine
  reasoning and machine intelligence. But, currently available causal inference algorithms
  operate in specific regimes, and rely on assumptions that are difficult to verify
  in practice.   This thesis advances the art of causal inference in three different
  ways. First, we develop a framework for the study of statistical dependence based
  on copulas and random features. Second, we build on this framework to interpret
  the problem of causal inference as the task of distribution classification, yielding
  a family of novel causal inference algorithms. Third, we discover causal structures
  in convolutional neural network features using our algorithms. The algorithms presented
  in this thesis are scalable, exhibit strong theoretical guarantees, and achieve
  state-of-the-art performance in a variety of real-world benchmarks.
