abstract: Reactive synthesis is a technology for the automatic construction of reactive
  systems from logical specifications. In these lecture notes, we study different
  algorithms for the reactive synthesis problem of linear-time temporal logic (LTL).
  The classic game-based synthesis algorithm is input-sensitive in the sense that
  its performance is asymptotically optimal in the size of the specification, but
  it produces implementations that may be larger than necessary. We contrast this
  algorithm with output-sensitive algorithms for reactive synthesis, i.e., algorithms
  that are optimized towards the size or structural complexity of the synthesized
  system. We study the bounded synthesis algorithm, which produces an implementation
  with a minimal number of states, and the bounded cycle synthesis algorithm, which
  additionally guarantees that the number of cycles of the implementation is minimal.
