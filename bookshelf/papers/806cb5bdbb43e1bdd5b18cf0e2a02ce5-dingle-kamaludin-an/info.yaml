abstract: For a broad class of input-output maps, arguments based on the coding theorem
  from algorithmic information theory (AIT) predict that simple (low Kolmogorov complexity)
  outputs are exponentially more likely to occur upon uniform random sampling of inputs
  than complex outputs are. Here, we derive probability bounds that are based on the
  complexities of the inputs as well as the outputs, rather than just on the complexities
  of the outputs. The more that outputs deviate from the coding theorem bound, the
  lower the complexity of their inputs. Our new bounds are tested for an RNA sequence
  to structure map, a finite state transducer and a perceptron. These results open
  avenues for AIT to be more widely used in physics.
