abstract: We present a rigorous framework for the composition of Web Services within
  a higher order logic theorem prover. Our approach is based on the proofs-as-processes
  paradigm that enables inference rules of Classical Linear Logic (CLL) to be translated
  into pi-calculus processes. In this setting, composition is achieved by representing
  available web services as CLL sentences, proving the requested composite service
  as a conjecture, and then extracting the constructed pi-calculus term from the proof.
  Our framework, implemented in HOL Light, not only uses an expressive logic that
  allows us to incorporate multiple Web Services properties in the composition process,
  but also provides guarantees of soundness and correctness for the composition.
