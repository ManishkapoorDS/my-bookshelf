abstract: The main purpose of this article is to describe the taxonomy of computer
  languages according to the levels of abstraction. There exists so many computer
  languages because of so many reasons like the evolution of better computer languages
  over the time; the socio-economic factors as the proprietary interests, commercial
  advantages; expressive power; ease of use of novice; orientation toward special
  purposes; orientation toward special hardware; and diverse ideas about most suitability.
  Moreover, the important common properties of most of these languages are discussed
  here. No programming language is designed in a vacuity, but it solves some specific
  kinds of problems. There is a different framework for each problem and best suitable
  framework for each problem. A single framework is not best for all types of problems.
  So, it is important to select vigilantly the frameworks supported by the language.
  The five generation of the computer programming languages are explored in this paper
  to some extent.
