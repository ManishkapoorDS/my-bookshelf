abstract: In this paper we address the problem of the uniform random generation of
  non deterministic automata (NFA) up to isomorphism. First, we show how to use a
  Monte-Carlo approach to uniformly sample a NFA. Secondly, we show how to use the
  Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm to uniformly generate NFAs up to isomorphism. Using
  labeling techniques, we show that in practice it is possible to move into the modified
  Markov Chain efficiently, allowing the random generation of NFAs up to isomorphism
  with dozens of states. This general approach is also applied to several interesting
  subclasses of NFAs (up to isomorphism), such as NFAs having a unique initial states
  and a bounded output degree. Finally, we prove that for these interesting subclasses
  of NFAs, moving into the Metropolis Markov chain can be done in polynomial time.
  Promising experimental results constitute a practical contribution.
