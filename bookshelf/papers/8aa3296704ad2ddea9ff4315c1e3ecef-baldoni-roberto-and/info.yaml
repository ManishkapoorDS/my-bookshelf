abstract: 'Many security and software testing applications require checking whether
  certain properties of a program hold for any possible usage scenario. For instance,
  a tool for identifying software vulnerabilities may need to rule out the existence
  of any backdoor to bypass a program''s authentication. One approach would be to
  test the program using different, possibly random inputs. As the backdoor may only
  be hit for very specific program workloads, automated exploration of the space of
  possible inputs is of the essence. Symbolic execution provides an elegant solution
  to the problem, by systematically exploring many possible execution paths at the
  same time without necessarily requiring concrete inputs. Rather than taking on fully
  specified input values, the technique abstractly represents them as symbols, resorting
  to constraint solvers to construct actual instances that would cause property violations.
  Symbolic execution has been incubated in dozens of tools developed over the last
  four decades, leading to major practical breakthroughs in a number of prominent
  software reliability applications. The goal of this survey is to provide an overview
  of the main ideas, challenges, and solutions developed in the area, distilling them
  for a broad audience.   The present survey has been accepted for publication at
  ACM Computing Surveys. If you are considering citing this survey, we would appreciate
