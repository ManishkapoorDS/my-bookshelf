abstract: 'As robots leave the controlled environments of factories to autonomously
  function in more complex, natural environments, they will have to respond to the
  inevitable fact that they will become damaged. However, while animals can quickly
  adapt to a wide variety of injuries, current robots cannot "think outside the box"
  to find a compensatory behavior when damaged: they are limited to their pre-specified
  self-sensing abilities, can diagnose only anticipated failure modes, and require
  a pre-programmed contingency plan for every type of potential damage, an impracticality
  for complex robots. Here we introduce an intelligent trial and error algorithm that
  allows robots to adapt to damage in less than two minutes, without requiring self-diagnosis
  or pre-specified contingency plans. Before deployment, a robot exploits a novel
  algorithm to create a detailed map of the space of high-performing behaviors: This
  map represents the robot''s intuitions about what behaviors it can perform and their
  value. If the robot is damaged, it uses these intuitions to guide a trial-and-error
  learning algorithm that conducts intelligent experiments to rapidly discover a compensatory
  behavior that works in spite of the damage. Experiments reveal successful adaptations
  for a legged robot injured in five different ways, including damaged, broken, and
  missing legs, and for a robotic arm with joints broken in 14 different ways. This
  new technique will enable more robust, effective, autonomous robots, and suggests
  principles that animals may use to adapt to injury.'
