abstract: <jats:p>Within the broad field of spoken dialogue systems, the application
  of machine-learning approaches to dialogue management strategy design is a rapidly
  growing research area. The main motivation is the hope of building systems that
  learn through trial-and-error interaction what constitutes a good dialogue strategy.
  Training of such systems could in theory be done using human users or using corpora
  of human–computer dialogue, but in practice the typically vast space of possible
  dialogue states and strategies cannot be explored without the use of automatic user
  simulation tools.</jats:p><jats:p>This requirement for training statistical dialogue
  models has created an interesting new application area for predictive statistical
  user modelling and a variety of different techniques for simulating user behaviour
  have been presented in the literature ranging from simple Markov models to Bayesian
  networks. The development of reliable user simulation tools is critical to further
  progress on automatic dialogue management design but it holds many challenges, some
  of which have been encountered in other areas of current research on statistical
  user modelling, such as the problem of ‘concept drift’, the problem of combining
  content-based and collaboration-based modelling techniques, and user model evaluation.
  The latter topic is of particular interest, because simulation-based learning is
  currently one of the few applications of statistical user modelling that employs
  both direct ‘accuracy-based’ and indirect ‘utility-based’ evaluation techniques.</jats:p><jats:p>In
  this paper, we briefly summarize the role of the dialogue manager in a spoken dialogue
  system, give a short introduction to reinforcement-learning of dialogue management
  strategies and review the literature on user modelling for simulation-based strategy
  learning. We further describe recent work on user model evaluation and discuss some
  of the current research issues in simulation-based learning from a user modelling
  perspective.</jats:p>
