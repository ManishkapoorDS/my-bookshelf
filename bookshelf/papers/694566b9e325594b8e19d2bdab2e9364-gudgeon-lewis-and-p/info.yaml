abstract: The Global Financial Crisis of 2008, caused by excessive financial risk,
  inspired Nakamoto to create Bitcoin. Now, more than ten years later, Decentralized
  Finance (DeFi), a peer-to-peer financial paradigm which leverages blockchain-based
  smart contracts to ensure its integrity and security, contains over 1bn USD of capital
  as of February 2020. Yet as this ecosystem develops, with protocols intertwining
  and the complexity of financial products increasing, it is at risk of the very sort
  of financial meltdown it is supposed to be preventing.   In this paper we explore
  how design weaknesses in DeFi protocols could lead to a DeFi crisis. First, overcollateralized
  DeFi protocols are vulnerable to exogenous price shocks. We quantify the robustness
  of DeFi lending protocols in the presence of significant falls in the value of the
  assets these protocols are based on, showing for a range of parameters the speed
  at which a DeFi protocol would become undercollateralized. Second, we present a
  governance attack on Maker - the largest DeFi protocol by market share - that allows
  an attacker to steal all 0.5bn USD worth of collateral. Moreover, we present a novel
  strategy that would allow an attacker to steal the Maker collateral within just
  two transactions and without the need to lock any tokens. This paper shows that
  with the composition of collateralized debt in these DeFi protocols, the failure
  of one protocol may lead to financial contagion, resulting in losses ranging from
  145m USD to in excess of 246m USD.
