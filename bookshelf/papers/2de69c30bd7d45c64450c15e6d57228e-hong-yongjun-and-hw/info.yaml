abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have received wide attention in the
  machine learning field for their potential to learn high-dimensional, complex real
  data distribution. Specifically, they do not rely on any assumptions about the distribution
  and can generate real-like samples from latent space in a simple manner. This powerful
  property leads GAN to be applied to various applications such as image synthesis,
  image attribute editing, image translation, domain adaptation and other academic
  fields. In this paper, we aim to discuss the details of GAN for those readers who
  are familiar with, but do not comprehend GAN deeply or who wish to view GAN from
  various perspectives. In addition, we explain how GAN operates and the fundamental
  meaning of various objective functions that have been suggested recently. We then
  focus on how the GAN can be combined with an autoencoder framework. Finally, we
  enumerate the GAN variants that are applied to various tasks and other fields for
  those who are interested in exploiting GAN for their research.
