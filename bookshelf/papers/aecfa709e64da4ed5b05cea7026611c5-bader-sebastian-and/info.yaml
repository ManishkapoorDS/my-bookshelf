abstract: Research on integrated neural-symbolic systems has made significant progress
  in the recent past. In particular the understanding of ways to deal with symbolic
  knowledge within connectionist systems (also called artificial neural networks)
  has reached a critical mass which enables the community to strive for applicable
  implementations and use cases. Recent work has covered a great variety of logics
  used in artificial intelligence and provides a multitude of techniques for dealing
  with them within the context of artificial neural networks. We present a comprehensive
  survey of the field of neural-symbolic integration, including a new classification
  of system according to their architectures and abilities.
