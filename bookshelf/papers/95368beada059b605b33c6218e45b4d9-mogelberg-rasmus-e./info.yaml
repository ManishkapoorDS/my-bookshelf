abstract: Just like any other branch of mathematics, denotational semantics of programming
  languages should be formalised in type theory, but adapting traditional domain theoretic
  semantics, as originally formulated in classical set theory to type theory has proven
  challenging. This paper is part of a project on formulating denotational semantics
  in type theories with guarded recursion. This should have the benefit of not only
  giving simpler semantics and proofs of properties such as adequacy, but also hopefully
  in the future to scale to languages with advanced features, such as general references,
  outside the reach of traditional domain theoretic techniques. Working in Guarded
  Dependent Type Theory (GDTT), we develop denotational semantics for FPC, the simply
  typed lambda calculus extended with recursive types, modelling the recursive types
  of FPC using the guarded recursive types of GDTT. We prove soundness and computational
  adequacy of the model in GDTT using a logical relation between syntax and semantics
  constructed also using guarded recursive types. The denotational semantics is intensional
  in the sense that it counts the number of unfold-fold reductions needed to compute
  the value of a term, but we construct a relation relating the denotations of extensionally
  equal terms, i.e., pairs of terms that compute the same value in a different number
  of steps. Finally we show how the denotational semantics of terms can be executed
  inside type theory and prove that executing the denotation of a boolean term computes
  the same value as the operational semantics of FPC.
