abstract: Recently, width-based planning methods have been shown to yield state-of-the-art
  results in the Atari 2600 video games. For this, the states were associated with
  the (RAM) memory states of the simulator. In this work, we consider the same planning
  problem but using the screen instead. By using the same visual inputs, the planning
  results can be compared with those of humans and learning methods. We show that
  the planning approach, out of the box and without training, results in scores that
  compare well with those obtained by humans and learning methods, and moreover, by
  developing an episodic, rollout version of the IW(k) algorithm, we show that such
  scores can be obtained in almost real time.
