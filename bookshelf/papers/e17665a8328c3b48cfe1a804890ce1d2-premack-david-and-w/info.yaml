abstract: <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>An individual has a theory of mind
  if he imputes mental states to himself and others. A system of inferences of this
  kind is properly viewed as a theory because such states are not directly observable,
  and the system can be used to make predictions about the behavior of others. As
  to the mental states the chimpanzee may infer, consider those inferred by our own
  species, for example, <jats:italic>purpose</jats:italic> or <jats:italic>intention</jats:italic>,
  as well as <jats:italic>knowledge, belief, thinking, doubt, guessing, pretending,
  liking</jats:italic>, and so forth. To determine whether or not the chimpanzee infers
  states of this kind, we showed an adult chimpanzee a series of videotaped scenes
  of a human actor struggling with a variety of problems. Some problems were simple,
  involving inaccessible food – bananas vertically or horizontally out of reach, behind
  a box, and so forth – as in the original Kohler problems; others were more complex,
  involving an actor unable to extricate himself from a locked cage, shivering because
  of a malfunctioning heater, or unable to play a phonograph because it was unplugged.
  With each videotape the chimpanzee was given several photographs, one a solution
  to the problem, such as a stick for the inaccessible bananas, a key for the locked
  up actor, a lit wick for the malfunctioning heater. The chimpanzee's consistent
  choice of the correct photographs can be understood by assuming that the animal
  recognized the videotape as representing a problem, understood the actor's purpose,
  and chose alternatives compatible with that purpose.</jats:p>
