abstract: In 1952, Heinrich Scholz published a question in the Journal of Symbolic
  Logic asking for a characterization of spectra, i.e., sets of natural numbers that
  are the cardinalities of finite models of first order sentences. G\"unter Asser
  asked whether the complement of a spectrum is always a spectrum. These innocent
  questions turned out to be seminal for the development of finite model theory and
  descriptive complexity. In this paper we survey developments over the last 50-odd
  years pertaining to the spectrum problem. Our presentation follows conceptual developments
  rather than the chronological order. Originally a number theoretic problem, it has
  been approached in terms of recursion theory, resource bounded complexity theory,
  classification by complexity of the defining sentences, and finally in terms of
  structural graph theory. Although Scholz' question was answered in various ways,
  Asser's question remains open. One appendix paraphrases the contents of several
  early and not easily accesible papers by G. Asser, A. Mostowski, J. Bennett and
  S. Mo. Another appendix contains a compendium of questions and conjectures which
  remain open.
