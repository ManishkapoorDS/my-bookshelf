abstract: Algorithm design is a laborious process and often requires many iterations
  of ideation and validation. In this paper, we explore automating algorithm design
  and present a method to learn an optimization algorithm, which we believe to be
  the first method that can automatically discover a better algorithm. We approach
  this problem from a reinforcement learning perspective and represent any particular
  optimization algorithm as a policy. We learn an optimization algorithm using guided
  policy search and demonstrate that the resulting algorithm outperforms existing
  hand-engineered algorithms in terms of convergence speed and/or the final objective
  value.
