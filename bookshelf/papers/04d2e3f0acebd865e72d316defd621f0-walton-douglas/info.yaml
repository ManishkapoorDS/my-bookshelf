abstract: <jats:p>This paper, based on research in a forthcoming monograph, Commitment
  in Dialogue, undertaken jointly with Erik Krabbe, explains several informal fallacies
  as shifts from one type of dialogue to another. The normative framework is that
  of a dialogue where two parties reason together, incurring and retracting commitments
  to various propositions as the dialogue continues. The fallacies studied include
  the ad hominem, the slippery slope, and many questions.</jats:p>
