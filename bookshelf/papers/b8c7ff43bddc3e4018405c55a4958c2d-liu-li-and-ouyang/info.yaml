abstract: 'Object detection, one of the most fundamental and challenging problems
  in computer vision, seeks to locate object instances from a large number of predefined
  categories in natural images. Deep learning techniques have emerged as a powerful
  strategy for learning feature representations directly from data and have led to
  remarkable breakthroughs in the field of generic object detection. Given this period
  of rapid evolution, the goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey
  of the recent achievements in this field brought about by deep learning techniques.
  More than 300 research contributions are included in this survey, covering many
  aspects of generic object detection: detection frameworks, object feature representation,
  object proposal generation, context modeling, training strategies, and evaluation
  metrics. We finish the survey by identifying promising directions for future research.'
