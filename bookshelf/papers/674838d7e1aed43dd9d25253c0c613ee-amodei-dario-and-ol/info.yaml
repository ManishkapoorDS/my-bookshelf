abstract: 'Rapid progress in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) has
  brought increasing attention to the potential impacts of AI technologies on society.
  In this paper we discuss one such potential impact: the problem of accidents in
  machine learning systems, defined as unintended and harmful behavior that may emerge
  from poor design of real-world AI systems. We present a list of five practical research
  problems related to accident risk, categorized according to whether the problem
  originates from having the wrong objective function ("avoiding side effects" and
  "avoiding reward hacking"), an objective function that is too expensive to evaluate
  frequently ("scalable supervision"), or undesirable behavior during the learning
  process ("safe exploration" and "distributional shift"). We review previous work
  in these areas as well as suggesting research directions with a focus on relevance
  to cutting-edge AI systems. Finally, we consider the high-level question of how
  to think most productively about the safety of forward-looking applications of AI.'
