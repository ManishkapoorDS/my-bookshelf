abstract: 'This work reviews the understanding of the direction of time introduced
  by Hans Reichenbach, including the fundamental relation of the perceived flow of
  time to the second law of thermodynamics (i.e. the Boltzmann time hypothesis), and
  the principle of parallelism of entropy increase. An example of a mixing process
  with quantum effects, which is advanced here in conjunction with Reichenbach''s
  ideas, indicates the existence of a presently unknown mechanism that reflects global
  conditions prevailing in the universe and enacts the direction of time locally (i.e.
  the "time primer"). The possibility of experimental detection of the time primer
  is also discussed: if the time primer is CPT-invariant, its detection may be possible
  in high-energy experiments under the current level of technology.'
