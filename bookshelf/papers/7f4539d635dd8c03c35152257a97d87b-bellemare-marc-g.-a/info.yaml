abstract: 'In this article we introduce the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE): both
  a challenge problem and a platform and methodology for evaluating the development
  of general, domain-independent AI technology. ALE provides an interface to hundreds
  of Atari 2600 game environments, each one different, interesting, and designed to
  be a challenge for human players. ALE presents significant research challenges for
  reinforcement learning, model learning, model-based planning, imitation learning,
  transfer learning, and intrinsic motivation. Most importantly, it provides a rigorous
  testbed for evaluating and comparing approaches to these problems. We illustrate
  the promise of ALE by developing and benchmarking domain-independent agents designed
  using well-established AI techniques for both reinforcement learning and planning.
  In doing so, we also propose an evaluation methodology made possible by ALE, reporting
  empirical results on over 55 different games. All of the software, including the
  benchmark agents, is publicly available.'
