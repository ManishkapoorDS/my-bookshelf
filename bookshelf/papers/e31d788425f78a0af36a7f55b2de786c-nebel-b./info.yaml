abstract: The recent approaches of extending the GRAPHPLAN algorithm to handle more
  expressive planning formalisms raise the question of what the formal meaning of
  "expressive power" is. We formalize the intuition that expressive power is a measure
  of how concisely planning domains and plans can be expressed in a particular formalism
  by introducing the notion of "compilation schemes" between planning formalisms.
  Using this notion, we analyze the expressiveness of a large family of propositional
  planning formalisms, ranging from basic STRIPS to a formalism with conditional effects,
  partial state specifications, and propositional formulae in the preconditions. One
  of the results is that conditional effects cannot be compiled away if plan size
  should grow only linearly but can be compiled away if we allow for polynomial growth
  of the resulting plans. This result confirms that the recently proposed extensions
  to the GRAPHPLAN algorithm concerning conditional effects are optimal with respect
  to the "compilability" framework. Another result is that general propositional formulae
  cannot be compiled into conditional effects if the plan size should be preserved
  linearly. This implies that allowing general propositional formulae in preconditions
  and effect conditions adds another level of difficulty in generating a plan.
