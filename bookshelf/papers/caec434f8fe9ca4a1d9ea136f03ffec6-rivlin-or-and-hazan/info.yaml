abstract: A hallmark of intelligence is the ability to deduce general principles from
  examples, which are correct beyond the range of those observed. Generalized Planning
  deals with finding such principles for a class of planning problems, so that principles
  discovered using small instances of a domain can be used to solve much larger instances
  of the same domain. In this work we study the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning
  and Graph Neural Networks to learn such generalized policies and demonstrate that
  they can generalize to instances that are orders of magnitude larger than those
  they were trained on.
