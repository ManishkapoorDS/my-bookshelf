abstract: <p>This chapter provides an overview of classical formal language theory.
  The text is focused on the definition of the fundamental concepts of language, grammar,
  and automata, and introduces some basic related notions. We also present the hierarchical
  classification of formal grammars proposed by N. Chomsky in the 1950s, known as
  the Chomsky hierarchy. The location of natural languages in this hierarchy is also
  discussed, together with the concept of Mildly Context Sensitivity. In the last
  part of the chapter, other formalisms that have interesting linguistic and computational
  properties are briefly introduced. The chapter concludes with a short review of
  grammatical inference, a subfield of machine learning that deals with the process
  of learning grammars and languages from data.</p>
