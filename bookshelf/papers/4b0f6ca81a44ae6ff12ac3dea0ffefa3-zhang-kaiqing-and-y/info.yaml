abstract: 'Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has long been a significant and
  everlasting research topic in both machine learning and control. With the recent
  development of (single-agent) deep RL, there is a resurgence of interests in developing
  new MARL algorithms, especially those that are backed by theoretical analysis. In
  this paper, we review some recent advances a sub-area of this topic: decentralized
  MARL with networked agents. Specifically, multiple agents perform sequential decision-making
  in a common environment, without the coordination of any central controller. Instead,
  the agents are allowed to exchange information with their neighbors over a communication
  network. Such a setting finds broad applications in the control and operation of
  robots, unmanned vehicles, mobile sensor networks, and smart grid. This review is
  built upon several our research endeavors in this direction, together with some
  progresses made by other researchers along the line. We hope this review to inspire
  the devotion of more research efforts to this exciting yet challenging area.'
