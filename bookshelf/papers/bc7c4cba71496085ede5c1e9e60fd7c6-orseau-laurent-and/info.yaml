abstract: 'The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis is a conjecture that every large neural network
  contains a subnetwork that, when trained in isolation, achieves comparable performance
  to the large network. An even stronger conjecture has been proven recently: Every
  sufficiently overparameterized network contains a subnetwork that, even without
  training, achieves comparable accuracy to the trained large network. This theorem,
  however, relies on a number of strong assumptions and guarantees a polynomial factor
  on the size of the large network compared to the target function. In this work,
  we remove the most limiting assumptions of this previous work while providing significantly
  tighter bounds: the overparameterized network only needs a logarithmic factor (in
  all variables but depth) number of neurons per weight of the target subnetwork.'
