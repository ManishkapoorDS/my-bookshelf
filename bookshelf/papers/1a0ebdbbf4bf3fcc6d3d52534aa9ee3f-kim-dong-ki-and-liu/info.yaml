abstract: Collective learning can be greatly enhanced when agents effectively exchange
  knowledge with their peers. In particular, recent work studying agents that learn
  to teach other teammates has demonstrated that action advising accelerates team-wide
  learning. However, the prior work has simplified the learning of advising policies
  by using simple function approximations and only considering advising with primitive
  (low-level) actions, limiting the scalability of learning and teaching to complex
  domains. This paper introduces a novel learning-to-teach framework, called hierarchical
  multiagent teaching (HMAT), that improves scalability to complex environments by
  using the deep representation for student policies and by advising with more expressive
  extended action sequences over multiple levels of temporal abstraction. Our empirical
  evaluations demonstrate that HMAT improves team-wide learning progress in large,
  complex domains where previous approaches fail. HMAT also learns teaching policies
  that can effectively transfer knowledge to different teammates with knowledge of
  different tasks, even when the teammates have heterogeneous action spaces.
