abstract: The reproducibility of scientific experiment is vital for the advancement
  of disciplines based on previous work. To achieve this goal, many researchers focus
  on complex methodology and self-invented tools which have difficulty in practical
  usage. In this article, we introduce the DevOps infrastructure from software engineering
  community and shows how DevOps can be used effectively to reproduce experiments
  for computer science related disciplines. DevOps can be enabled using freely available
  cloud computing machines for medium sized experiment and self-hosted computing engines
  for large scale computing, thus powering researchers to share their experiment result
  with others in a more reliable way.
