abstract: This document describes concisely the ubiquitous class of exponential family
  distributions met in statistics. The first part recalls definitions and summarizes
  main properties and duality with Bregman divergences (all proofs are skipped). The
  second part lists decompositions and related formula of common exponential family
  distributions. We recall the Fisher-Rao-Riemannian geometries and the dual affine
  connection information geometries of statistical manifolds. It is intended to maintain
  and update this document and catalog by adding new distribution items.
