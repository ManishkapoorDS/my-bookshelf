abstract: 'Kalman filters and observers are two main classes of dynamic state estimation
  (DSE) routines. Power system DSE has been implemented by various Kalman filters,
  such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the unscented Kalman filter (UKF).
  In this paper, we discuss two challenges for an effective power system DSE: (a)
  model uncertainty and (b) potential cyber attacks. To address this, the cubature
  Kalman filter (CKF) and a nonlinear observer are introduced and implemented. Various
  Kalman filters and the observer are then tested on the 16-machine, 68-bus system
  given realistic scenarios under model uncertainty and different types of cyber attacks
  against synchrophasor measurements. It is shown that CKF and the observer are more
  robust to model uncertainty and cyber attacks than their counterparts. Based on
  the tests, a thorough qualitative comparison is also performed for Kalman filter
  routines and observers.'
