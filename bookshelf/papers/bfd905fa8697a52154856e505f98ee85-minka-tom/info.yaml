abstract: "A concise reference on advanced matrix theory, including: \n\n• an easy\
  \ way to compute matrix derivatives and second derivatives \n• a general framework\
  \ for inverting partitioned matrices \n• useful properties of Kronecker product,\
  \ Hadamard product, and diag \n• the column-stacking operator vec and its generalization\
  \ to vec-transpose \n\nwith applications to multilinear models, principal component\
  \ analysis, blind source separation, Lyapunov equations, model alignment, and more."
