abstract: Learning modular structures which reflect the dynamics of the environment
  can lead to better generalization and robustness to changes which only affect a
  few of the underlying causes. We propose Recurrent Independent Mechanisms (RIMs),
  a new recurrent architecture in which multiple groups of recurrent cells operate
  with nearly independent transition dynamics, communicate only sparingly through
  the bottleneck of attention, and are only updated at time steps where they are most
  relevant. We show that this leads to specialization amongst the RIMs, which in turn
  allows for dramatically improved generalization on tasks where some factors of variation
  differ systematically between training and evaluation.
