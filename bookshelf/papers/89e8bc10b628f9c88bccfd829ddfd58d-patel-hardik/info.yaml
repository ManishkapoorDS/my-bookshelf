abstract: Financial markets have been one of the earliest adopters of machine learning
  (ML). People have been using ML to spot patterns in the markets since 1980s. Even
  though ML has had enormous successes in predicting the market outcomes in the past,
  the recent advances in deep learning haven’t helped financial market predictions
  much. While deep learning and other ML techniques have finally made it possible
  for Alexa, Google Assistant and Google Photos to work, there hasn’t been much progress
  when it comes to stock markets.
