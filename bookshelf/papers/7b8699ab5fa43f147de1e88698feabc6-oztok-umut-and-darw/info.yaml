abstract: The sentential decision diagram (SDD) has been recently proposed as a new
  tractable representation of Boolean functions that generalizes the influential ordered
  binary decision diagram (OBDD). Empirically, compiling CNFs into SDDs has yielded
  significant improvements in both time and space over compiling them into OBDDs,
  using a bottom-up compilation approach. In this work, we present a top-down CNF
  to SDD compiler that is based on techniques from the SAT literature. We compare
  the presented compiler empirically to the state-of-the-art, bottom-up SDD compiler,
  showing orders-of-magnitude improvements in compilation time.
