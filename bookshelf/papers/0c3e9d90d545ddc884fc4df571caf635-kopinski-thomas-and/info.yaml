abstract: We present a novel hierarchical approach to multi-class classification which
  is generic in that it can be applied to different classification models (e.g., support
  vector machines, perceptrons), and makes no explicit assumptions about the probabilistic
  structure of the problem as it is usually done in multi-class classification. By
  adding a cascade of additional classifiers, each of which receives the previous
  classifier's output in addition to regular input data, the approach harnesses unused
  information that manifests itself in the form of, e.g., correlations between predicted
  classes. Using multilayer perceptrons as a classification model, we demonstrate
  the validity of this approach by testing it on a complex ten-class 3D gesture recognition
  task.
