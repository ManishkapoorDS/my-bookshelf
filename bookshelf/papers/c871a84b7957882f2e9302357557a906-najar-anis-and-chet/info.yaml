abstract: 'In this paper, we provide an overview of the existing methods for integrating
  human advice into a Reinforcement Learning process. We propose a taxonomy of different
  types of teaching signals, and present them according to three main aspects: how
  they can be provided to the learning agent, how they can be integrated into the
  learning process, and how they can be interpreted by the agent if their meaning
  is not determined beforehand. Finally, we compare the benefits and limitations of
  using each type of teaching signals, and propose a unified view of interactive learning
  methods.'
