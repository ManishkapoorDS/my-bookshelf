abstract: Person re-identification (re-id) has made great progress in recent years,
  but occlusion is still a challenging problem which significantly degenerates the
  identification performance. In this paper, we design a teacher-student learning
  framework to learn an occlusion-robust model from the full-body person domain to
  the occluded person domain. Notably, the teacher network only uses large-scale full-body
  person data to simulate the learning process of occluded person re-id. Based on
  the teacher network, the student network then trains a better model by using inadequate
  real-world occluded person data. In order to transfer more knowledge from the teacher
  network to the student network, we equip the proposed framework with a co-saliency
  network and a cross-domain simulator. The co-saliency network extracts the backbone
  features, and two separated collaborative branches are followed by the backbone.
  One branch is a classification branch for identity recognition and the other is
  a co-saliency branch for guiding the network to highlight meaningful parts without
  any manual annotation. The cross-domain simulator generates artificial occlusions
  on full-body person data under a growing probability so that the teacher network
  could train a cross-domain model by observing more and more occluded cases. Experiments
  on four occluded person re-id benchmarks show that our method outperforms other
  state-of-the-art methods.
