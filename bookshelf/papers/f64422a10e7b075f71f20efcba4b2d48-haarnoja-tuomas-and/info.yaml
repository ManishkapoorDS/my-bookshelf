abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) holds the promise of automating the
  acquisition of complex controllers that can map sensory inputs directly to low-level
  actions. In the domain of robotic locomotion, deep RL could enable learning locomotion
  skills with minimal engineering and without an explicit model of the robot dynamics.
  Unfortunately, applying deep RL to real-world robotic tasks is exceptionally difficult,
  primarily due to poor sample complexity and sensitivity to hyperparameters. While
  hyperparameters can be easily tuned in simulated domains, tuning may be prohibitively
  expensive on physical systems, such as legged robots, that can be damaged through
  extensive trial-and-error learning. In this paper, we propose a sample-efficient
  deep RL algorithm based on maximum entropy RL that requires minimal per-task tuning
  and only a modest number of trials to learn neural network policies. We apply this
  method to learning walking gaits on a real-world Minitaur robot. Our method can
  acquire a stable gait from scratch directly in the real world in about two hours,
  without relying on any model or simulation, and the resulting policy is robust to
  moderate variations in the environment. We further show that our algorithm achieves
  state-of-the-art performance on simulated benchmarks with a single set of hyperparameters.
  Videos of training and the learned policy can be found on the project website.
