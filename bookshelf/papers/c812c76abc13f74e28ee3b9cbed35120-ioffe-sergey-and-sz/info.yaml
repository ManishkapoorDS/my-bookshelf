abstract: 'Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution
  of each layer''s inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous
  layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and
  careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models
  with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate
  shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its
  strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing
  the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to
  use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also
  acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to
  a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the
  same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by
  a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve
  upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5 validation
  error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.'
