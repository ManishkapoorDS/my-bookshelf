abstract: A broadly applicable algorithm for computing maximum likelihood estimates
  from incomplete data is presented at various levels of generality. Theory showing
  the monotone behaviour of the likelihood and convergence of the algorithm is derived.
  Many examples are sketched, including missing value situations, applications to
  grouped, censored or truncated data, finite mixture models, variance component estimation,
  hyperparameter estimation, iteratively reweighted least squares and factor analysis.
