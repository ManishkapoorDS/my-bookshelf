abstract: Quantitative properties of stochastic systems are usually specified in logics
  that allow one to compare the measure of executions satisfying certain temporal
  properties with thresholds. The model checking problem for stochastic systems with
  respect to such logics is typically solved by a numerical approach that iteratively
  computes (or approximates) the exact measure of paths satisfying relevant subformulas;
  the algorithms themselves depend on the class of systems being analyzed as well
  as the logic used for specifying the properties. Another approach to solve the model
  checking problem is to \emph{simulate} the system for finitely many runs, and use
  \emph{hypothesis testing} to infer whether the samples provide a \emph{statistical}
  evidence for the satisfaction or violation of the specification. In this short paper,
  we survey the statistical approach, and outline its main advantages in terms of
  efficiency, uniformity, and simplicity.
