abstract: 'We present new planning and learning algorithms for RAE, the Refinement
  Acting Engine. RAE uses hierarchical operational models to perform tasks in dynamically
  changing environments. Our planning procedure, UPOM, does a UCT-like search in the
  space of operational models in order to find a near-optimal method to use for the
  task and context at hand. Our learning strategies acquire, from online acting experiences
  and/or simulated planning results, a mapping from decision contexts to method instances
  as well as a heuristic function to guide UPOM. Our experimental results show that
  UPOM and our learning strategies significantly improve RAE''s performance in four
  test domains using two different metrics: efficiency and success ratio.'
