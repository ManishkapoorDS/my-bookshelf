abstract: An algorithm $M$ is described that solves any well-defined problem $p$ as
  quickly as the fastest algorithm computing a solution to $p$, save for a factor
  of 5 and low-order additive terms. $M$ optimally distributes resources between the
  execution of provably correct $p$-solving programs and an enumeration of all proofs,
  including relevant proofs of program correctness and of time bounds on program runtimes.
  $M$ avoids Blum's speed-up theorem by ignoring programs without correctness proof.
  $M$ has broader applicability and can be faster than Levin's universal search, the
  fastest method for inverting functions save for a large multiplicative constant.
  An extension of Kolmogorov complexity and two novel natural measures of function
  complexity are used to show that the most efficient program computing some function
  $f$ is also among the shortest programs provably computing $f$.
