abstract: With the continuous and vast increase in the amount of data in our digital
  world, it has been acknowledged that the number of knowledgeable data scientists
  can not scale to address these challenges. Thus, there was a crucial need for automating
  the process of building good machine learning models. In the last few years, several
  techniques and frameworks have been introduced to tackle the challenge of automating
  the process of Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyper-parameter tuning (CASH) in
  the machine learning domain. The main aim of these techniques is to reduce the role
  of the human in the loop and fill the gap for non-expert machine learning users
  by playing the role of the domain expert.   In this paper, we present a comprehensive
  survey for the state-of-the-art efforts in tackling the CASH problem. In addition,
  we highlight the research work of automating the other steps of the full complex
  machine learning pipeline (AutoML) from data understanding till model deployment.
  Furthermore, we provide comprehensive coverage for the various tools and frameworks
  that have been introduced in this domain. Finally, we discuss some of the research
  directions and open challenges that need to be addressed in order to achieve the
  vision and goals of the AutoML process.
