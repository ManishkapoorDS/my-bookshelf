abstract: 'We use reinforcement learning (RL) to learn dexterous in-hand manipulation
  policies which can perform vision-based object reorientation on a physical Shadow
  Dexterous Hand. The training is performed in a simulated environment in which we
  randomize many of the physical properties of the system like friction coefficients
  and an object''s appearance. Our policies transfer to the physical robot despite
  being trained entirely in simulation. Our method does not rely on any human demonstrations,
  but many behaviors found in human manipulation emerge naturally, including finger
  gaiting, multi-finger coordination, and the controlled use of gravity. Our results
  were obtained using the same distributed RL system that was used to train OpenAI
  Five. We also include a video of our results: https://youtu.be/jwSbzNHGflM'
