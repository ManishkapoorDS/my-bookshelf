abstract: This paper considers the optimal control of time varying continuous time
  Markov chains whose transition rates are themselves Markov processes. In one set
  of problems the solution of an ordinary differential equation is shown to determine
  the optimal performance and feedback controls, while some other cases are shown
  to lead to singular optimal control problems which are more difficult to solve.
  Solution techniques are demonstrated using examples from finance to behavioral decision
  making.
