abstract: We introduce the principle of Occam's Razor in a form which can be used
  as a basis for economical formulations of physics.   This allows us to explain the
  general structure of the Lagrangian for a composite physical system, as well as
  some other artificial postulates behind the variational formulations of physical
  laws.   As an example, we derive Hamilton's principle of stationary action together
  with the Lagrangians for the cases of Newtonian mechanics, relativistic mechanics
  and a relativistic particle in an external gravitational field.
