abstract: This paper presents a recent formalization of a Henkin-style completeness
  proof for the propositional modal logic S5 using the Lean theorem prover. The proof
  formalized is close to that of Hughes and Cresswell [9], except that it is given
  for a system based on a different choice of axioms. Here the proof is based on a
  Hilbert-style presentation better described as a Mendelson system augmented with
  axiom schemes for K, T, S4, and B, and the necessitation rule as rule of inference.
  The language has the false and implication as the only primitive logical connectives
  and necessity as the only primitive modal operator. The full source code is available
  online and has been typechecked with Lean 3.4.1.
