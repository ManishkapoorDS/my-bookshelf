abstract: Deep reinforcement learning is the combination of reinforcement learning
  (RL) and deep learning. This field of research has been able to solve a wide range
  of complex decision-making tasks that were previously out of reach for a machine.
  Thus, deep RL opens up many new applications in domains such as healthcare, robotics,
  smart grids, finance, and many more. This manuscript provides an introduction to
  deep reinforcement learning models, algorithms and techniques. Particular focus
  is on the aspects related to generalization and how deep RL can be used for practical
  applications. We assume the reader is familiar with basic machine learning concepts.
