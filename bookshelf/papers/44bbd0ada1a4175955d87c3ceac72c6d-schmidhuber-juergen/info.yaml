abstract: We present the first class of mathematically rigorous, general, fully self-referential,
  self-improving, optimally efficient problem solvers. Inspired by Kurt Goedel's celebrated
  self-referential formulas (1931), such a problem solver rewrites any part of its
  own code as soon as it has found a proof that the rewrite is useful, where the problem-dependent
  utility function and the hardware and the entire initial code are described by axioms
  encoded in an initial proof searcher which is also part of the initial code. The
  searcher systematically and efficiently tests computable proof techniques (programs
  whose outputs are proofs) until it finds a provably useful, computable self-rewrite.
  We show that such a self-rewrite is globally optimal - no local maxima! - since
  the code first had to prove that it is not useful to continue the proof search for
  alternative self-rewrites. Unlike previous non-self-referential methods based on
  hardwired proof searchers, ours not only boasts an optimal order of complexity but
  can optimally reduce any slowdowns hidden by the O()-notation, provided the utility
  of such speed-ups is provable at all.
