abstract: <jats:p>SymPy is an open source computer algebra system written in pure
  Python. It is built with a focus on extensibility and ease of use, through both
  interactive and programmatic applications. These characteristics have led SymPy
  to become a popular symbolic library for the scientific Python ecosystem. This paper
  presents the architecture of SymPy, a description of its features, and a discussion
  of select submodules. The supplementary material provide additional examples and
  further outline details of the architecture and features of SymPy.</jats:p>
