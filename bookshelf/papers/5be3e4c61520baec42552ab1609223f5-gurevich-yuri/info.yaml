abstract: 'What is an algorithm? The interest in this foundational problem is not
  only theoretical; applications include specification, validation and verification
  of software and hardware systems. We describe the quest to understand and define
  the notion of algorithm. We start with the Church-Turing thesis and contrast Church''s
  and Turing''s approaches, and we finish with some recent investigations.
