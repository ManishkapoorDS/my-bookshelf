abstract: <jats:p>In many real-world hybrid (mixed discrete continuous) planning problems
  such as Reservoir Control, Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC), and
  Navigation, it is difficult to obtain a model of the complex nonlinear dynamics
  that govern state evolution.  However, the ubiquity of modern sensors allow us to
  collect large quantities of data from each of these complex systems and build accurate,
  nonlinear deep network models of their state transitions.  But there remains one
  major problem for the task of control -- how can we plan with deep network learned
  transition models without resorting to Monte Carlo Tree Search and other black-box
  transition model techniques that ignore model structure and do not easily extend
  to mixed discrete and continuous domains? In this paper, we make the critical observation
  that the popular Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) transfer function for deep networks
  not only allows accurate nonlinear deep net model learning, but also permits a direct
  compilation of the deep network transition model to a Mixed-Integer Linear Program
  (MILP) encoding in a planner we call Hybrid Deep MILP Planning (HD-MILP-PLAN). We
  identify deep net specific optimizations and a simple sparsification method for
  HD-MILP-PLAN that improve performance over a naive encoding, and show that we are
  able to plan optimally with respect to the learned deep network.</jats:p>
