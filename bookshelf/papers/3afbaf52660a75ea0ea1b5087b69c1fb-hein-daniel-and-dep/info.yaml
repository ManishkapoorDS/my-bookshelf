abstract: In the research area of reinforcement learning (RL), frequently novel and
  promising methods are developed and introduced to the RL community. However, although
  many researchers are keen to apply their methods on real-world problems, implementing
  such methods in real industry environments often is a frustrating and tedious process.
  Generally, academic research groups have only limited access to real industrial
  data and applications. For this reason, new methods are usually developed, evaluated
  and compared by using artificial software benchmarks. On one hand, these benchmarks
  are designed to provide interpretable RL training scenarios and detailed insight
  into the learning process of the method on hand. On the other hand, they usually
  do not share much similarity with industrial real-world applications. For this reason
  we used our industry experience to design a benchmark which bridges the gap between
  freely available, documented, and motivated artificial benchmarks and properties
  of real industrial problems. The resulting industrial benchmark (IB) has been made
  publicly available to the RL community by publishing its Java and Python code, including
  an OpenAI Gym wrapper, on Github. In this paper we motivate and describe in detail
  the IB's dynamics and identify prototypic experimental settings that capture common
  situations in real-world industry control problems.
