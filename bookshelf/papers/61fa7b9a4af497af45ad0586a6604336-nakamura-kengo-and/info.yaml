abstract: The Sentential Decision Diagram (SDD) is a tractable representation of Boolean
  functions that subsumes the famous Ordered Binary Decision Diagram (OBDD) as a strict
  subset. SDDs are attracting much attention because they are more succinct than OBDDs,
  as well as having canonical forms and supporting many useful queries and transformations
  such as model counting and Apply operation. In this paper, we propose a more succinct
  variant of SDD named Variable Shift SDD (VS-SDD). The key idea is to create a unique
  representation for Boolean functions that are equivalent under a specific variable
  substitution. We show that VS-SDDs are never larger than SDDs and there are cases
  in which the size of a VS-SDD is exponentially smaller than that of an SDD. Moreover,
  despite such succinctness, we show that numerous basic operations that are supported
  in polytime with SDD are also supported in polytime with VS-SDD. Experiments confirm
  that VS-SDDs are significantly more succinct than SDDs when applied to classical
  planning instances, where inherent symmetry exists.
