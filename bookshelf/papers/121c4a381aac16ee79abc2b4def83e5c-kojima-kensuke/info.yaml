abstract: This paper studies a difference between Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs)
  and Zero-suppressed BDDs (ZDDs) from a conceptual point of view. It is commonly
  understood that a BDD is a representation of a Boolean function, whereas a ZDD is
  a representation of a set of sets. However, there is a one-to-one correspondence
  between Boolean functions and sets of sets, and therefore we could also regard a
  BDD as a representation of a set of sets, and similarly for a ZDD and a Boolean
  function. The aim of this paper is to give an explanation why the distinction between
  BDDs and ZDDs mentioned above is made despite the existence of the one-to-one correspondence.
  To achieve this, we first observe that Boolean functions and sets of sets are equipped
  with non-isomorphic functor structures, and show that these functor structures are
  reflected in the definitions of BDDs and ZDDs. This result can be stated formally
  as naturality of certain maps. To the author's knowledge, this is the first formally
  stated theorem that justifies the commonly accepted distinction between BDDs and
  ZDDs. In addition, we show that this result extends to sentential decision diagrams
  and their zero-suppressed variant.
