abstract: We combine the parametric Barvinok algorithm with a generation algorithm
  for a finite list of suitably chosen discrete sub-cases on the enumeration of complete
  simple games, i.e. a special subclass of monotone Boolean functions. Recently, Freixas
  et al. have proven an enumeration formula for complete simple games with two types
  of voters. We will provide a shorter proof and an enumeration formula for complete
  simple games with two shift-minimal winning coalitions.
