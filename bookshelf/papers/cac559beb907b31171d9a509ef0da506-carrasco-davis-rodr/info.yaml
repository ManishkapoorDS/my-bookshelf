abstract: We propose a new sequential classification model for astronomical objects
  based on a recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN) which uses sequences of
  images as inputs. This approach avoids the computation of light curves or difference
  images. This is the first time that sequences of images are used directly for the
  classification of variable objects in astronomy. The second contribution of this
  work is the image simulation process. We generate synthetic image sequences that
  take into account the instrumental and observing conditions, obtaining a realistic,
  set of movies for each astronomical object. The simulated dataset is used to train
  our RCNN classifier. This approach allows us to generate datasets to train and test
  our RCNN model for different astronomical surveys and telescopes. We aim at building
  a simulated dataset whose distribution is close enough to the real dataset, so that
  a fine tuning could match the distributions between real and simulated dataset.
  To test the RCNN classifier trained with the synthetic dataset, we used real-world
  data from the High cadence Transient Survey (HiTS) obtaining an average recall of
  85%, improved to 94% after performing fine tuning with 10 real samples per class.
  We compare the results of our model with those of a light curve random forest classifier.
  The proposed RCNN with fine tuning has a similar performance on the HiTS dataset
  compared to the light curve classifier, trained on an augmented training set with
  10 real samples per class. The RCNN approach presents several advantages in an alert
  stream classification scenario, such as a reduction of the data pre-processing,
  faster online evaluation and easier performance improvement using a few real data
  samples. These results encourage us to use this method for alert brokers systems
  that will process alert streams generated by new telescopes such as the Large Synoptic
  Survey Telescope.
