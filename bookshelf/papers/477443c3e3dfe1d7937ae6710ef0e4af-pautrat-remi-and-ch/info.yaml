abstract: One of the most interesting features of Bayesian optimization for direct
  policy search is that it can leverage priors (e.g., from simulation or from previous
  tasks) to accelerate learning on a robot. In this paper, we are interested in situations
  for which several priors exist but we do not know in advance which one fits best
  the current situation. We tackle this problem by introducing a novel acquisition
  function, called Most Likely Expected Improvement (MLEI), that combines the likelihood
  of the priors and the expected improvement. We evaluate this new acquisition function
  on a transfer learning task for a 5-DOF planar arm and on a possibly damaged, 6-legged
  robot that has to learn to walk on flat ground and on stairs, with priors corresponding
  to different stairs and different kinds of damages. Our results show that MLEI effectively
  identifies and exploits the priors, even when there is no obvious match between
  the current situations and the priors.
