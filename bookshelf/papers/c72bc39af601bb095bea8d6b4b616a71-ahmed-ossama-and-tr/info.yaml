abstract: Despite recent successes of reinforcement learning (RL), it remains a challenge
  for agents to transfer learned skills to related environments. To facilitate research
  addressing this problem, we propose CausalWorld, a benchmark for causal structure
  and transfer learning in a robotic manipulation environment. The environment is
  a simulation of an open-source robotic platform, hence offering the possibility
  of sim-to-real transfer. Tasks consist of constructing 3D shapes from a given set
  of blocks - inspired by how children learn to build complex structures. The key
  strength of CausalWorld is that it provides a combinatorial family of such tasks
  with common causal structure and underlying factors (including, e.g., robot and
  object masses, colors, sizes). The user (or the agent) may intervene on all causal
  variables, which allows for fine-grained control over how similar different tasks
  (or task distributions) are. One can thus easily define training and evaluation
  distributions of a desired difficulty level, targeting a specific form of generalization
  (e.g., only changes in appearance or object mass). Further, this common parametrization
  facilitates defining curricula by interpolating between an initial and a target
  task. While users may define their own task distributions, we present eight meaningful
  distributions as concrete benchmarks, ranging from simple to very challenging, all
  of which require long-horizon planning as well as precise low-level motor control.
  Finally, we provide baseline results for a subset of these tasks on distinct training
  curricula and corresponding evaluation protocols, verifying the feasibility of the
  tasks in this benchmark.
