abstract: Intelligent creatures can explore their environments and learn useful skills
  without supervision. In this paper, we propose DIAYN ('Diversity is All You Need'),
  a method for learning useful skills without a reward function. Our proposed method
  learns skills by maximizing an information theoretic objective using a maximum entropy
  policy. On a variety of simulated robotic tasks, we show that this simple objective
  results in the unsupervised emergence of diverse skills, such as walking and jumping.
  In a number of reinforcement learning benchmark environments, our method is able
  to learn a skill that solves the benchmark task despite never receiving the true
  task reward. We show how pretrained skills can provide a good parameter initialization
  for downstream tasks, and can be composed hierarchically to solve complex, sparse
  reward tasks. Our results suggest that unsupervised discovery of skills can serve
  as an effective pretraining mechanism for overcoming challenges of exploration and
  data efficiency in reinforcement learning.
