abstract: 'While current General Game Playing (GGP) systems facilitate useful research
  in Artificial Intelligence (AI) for game-playing, they are often somewhat specialised
  and computationally inefficient. In this paper, we describe the "ludemic" general
  game system Ludii, which has the potential to provide an efficient tool for AI researchers
  as well as game designers, historians, educators and practitioners in related fields.
  Ludii defines games as structures of ludemes -- high-level, easily understandable
  game concepts -- which allows for concise and human-understandable game descriptions.
  We formally describe Ludii and outline its main benefits: generality, extensibility,
  understandability and efficiency. Experimentally, Ludii outperforms one of the most
  efficient Game Description Language (GDL) reasoners, based on a propositional network,
  in all games available in the Tiltyard GGP repository. Moreover, Ludii is also competitive
  in terms of performance with the more recently proposed Regular Boardgames (RBG)
  system, and has various advantages in qualitative aspects such as generality.'
