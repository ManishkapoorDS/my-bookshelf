abstract: This thesis studies the parallelization of decision diagrams, a fundamental
  data-structure with applications in many fields, in particular symbolic model checking.
  Research into parallel processing is essential, as multi-core and many-core computers
  are ubiquitous. Graph algorithms such as decision diagram operations are known to
  be difficult to parallelize, as well as difficult to reason about. This is one of
  the reasons why parallelizing symbolic model checking is difficult. The main result
  of this research is the multi-core decision diagram package Sylvan. We investigate
  scalable hash tables, load balancing via work stealing, using Sylvan for symbolic
  state space exploration and for symbolic bisimulation minimization. The experimental
  results show high parallel speedup of up to 38x for benchmarks on a 48-core computer.
  Experiments that compare Sylvan to non-parallel decision diagram packages show that
  Sylvan is competitive when run with a single core, and faster when run with multiple
  cores.
