abstract: We summarize the potential impact that the European Union's new General
  Data Protection Regulation will have on the routine use of machine learning algorithms.
  Slated to take effect as law across the EU in 2018, it will restrict automated individual
  decision-making (that is, algorithms that make decisions based on user-level predictors)
  which "significantly affect" users. The law will also effectively create a "right
  to explanation," whereby a user can ask for an explanation of an algorithmic decision
  that was made about them. We argue that while this law will pose large challenges
  for industry, it highlights opportunities for computer scientists to take the lead
  in designing algorithms and evaluation frameworks which avoid discrimination and
  enable explanation.
