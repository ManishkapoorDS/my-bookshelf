abstract: We elaborate upon the theoretical foundations of a metric temporal extension
  of Answer Set Programming. In analogy to previous extensions of ASP with constructs
  from Linear Temporal and Dynamic Logic, we accomplish this in the setting of the
  logic of Here-and-There and its non-monotonic extension, called Equilibrium Logic.
  More precisely, we develop our logic on the same semantic underpinnings as its predecessors
  and thus use a simple time domain of bounded time steps. This allows us to compare
  all variants in a uniform framework and ultimately combine them in a common implementation.
