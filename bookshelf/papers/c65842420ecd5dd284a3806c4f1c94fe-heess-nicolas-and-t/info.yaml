abstract: The reinforcement learning paradigm allows, in principle, for complex behaviours
  to be learned directly from simple reward signals. In practice, however, it is common
  to carefully hand-design the reward function to encourage a particular solution,
  or to derive it from demonstration data. In this paper explore how a rich environment
  can help to promote the learning of complex behavior. Specifically, we train agents
  in diverse environmental contexts, and find that this encourages the emergence of
  robust behaviours that perform well across a suite of tasks. We demonstrate this
  principle for locomotion -- behaviours that are known for their sensitivity to the
  choice of reward. We train several simulated bodies on a diverse set of challenging
  terrains and obstacles, using a simple reward function based on forward progress.
  Using a novel scalable variant of policy gradient reinforcement learning, our agents
  learn to run, jump, crouch and turn as required by the environment without explicit
  reward-based guidance. A visual depiction of highlights of the learned behavior
  can be viewed following https://youtu.be/hx_bgoTF7bs .
