abstract: The development of intelligent machines is one of the biggest unsolved challenges
  in computer science. In this paper, we propose some fundamental properties these
  machines should have, focusing in particular on communication and learning. We discuss
  a simple environment that could be used to incrementally teach a machine the basics
  of natural-language-based communication, as a prerequisite to more complex interaction
  with human users. We also present some conjectures on the sort of algorithms the
  machine should support in order to profitably learn from the environment.
