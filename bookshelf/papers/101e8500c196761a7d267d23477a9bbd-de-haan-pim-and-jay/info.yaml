abstract: 'Behavioral cloning reduces policy learning to supervised learning by training
  a discriminative model to predict expert actions given observations. Such discriminative
  models are non-causal: the training procedure is unaware of the causal structure
  of the interaction between the expert and the environment. We point out that ignoring
  causality is particularly damaging because of the distributional shift in imitation
  learning. In particular, it leads to a counter-intuitive "causal misidentification"
  phenomenon: access to more information can yield worse performance. We investigate
  how this problem arises, and propose a solution to combat it through targeted interventions---either
  environment interaction or expert queries---to determine the correct causal model.
  We show that causal misidentification occurs in several benchmark control domains
  as well as realistic driving settings, and validate our solution against DAgger
  and other baselines and ablations.'
