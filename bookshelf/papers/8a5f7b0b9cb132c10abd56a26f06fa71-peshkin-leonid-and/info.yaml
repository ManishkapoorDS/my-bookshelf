abstract: 'In order for an agent to perform well in partially observable domains,
  it is usually necessary for actions to depend on the history of observations. In
  this paper, we explore a {\it stigmergic} approach, in which the agent''s actions
  include the ability to set and clear bits in an external memory, and the external
  memory is included as part of the input to the agent. In this case, we need to learn
  a reactive policy in a highly non-Markovian domain. We explore two algorithms: SARSA(\lambda),
  which has had empirical success in partially observable domains, and VAPS, a new
  algorithm due to Baird and Moore, with convergence guarantees in partially observable
  domains. We compare the performance of these two algorithms on benchmark problems.'
