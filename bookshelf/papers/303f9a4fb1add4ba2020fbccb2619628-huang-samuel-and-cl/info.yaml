abstract: This paper describes a method for converting formulas in finite propositional
  linear-time temporal logic (Finite LTL) into finite-state automata whose languages
  are the models of the given formula. Finite LTL differs from traditional LTL in
  that formulas are interpreted with respect to finite, rather than infinite, sequences
  of states; this fact means that traditional finite-state automata, rather than omega-automata
  such as those developed by Buchi and others, suffice for recognizing models of formulas.
  The approach considered is based on well-known tableau-construction techniques developed
  for LTL, which we adapt here for the setting of Finite LTL. The resulting automata
  may be used as a basis for model checking, satisfiability testing, and property
  monitoring of systems.
