abstract: This paper surveys research on applying neuroevolution (NE) to games. In
  neuroevolution, artificial neural networks are trained through evolutionary algorithms,
  taking inspiration from the way biological brains evolved. We analyse the application
  of NE in games along five different axes, which are the role NE is chosen to play
  in a game, the different types of neural networks used, the way these networks are
  evolved, how the fitness is determined and what type of input the network receives.
  The article also highlights important open research challenges in the field.
