abstract: We present a novel algorithm that uses exact learning and abstraction to
  extract a deterministic finite automaton describing the state dynamics of a given
  trained RNN. We do this using Angluin's L* algorithm as a learner and the trained
  RNN as an oracle. Our technique efficiently extracts accurate automata from trained
  RNNs, even when the state vectors are large and require fine differentiation.
