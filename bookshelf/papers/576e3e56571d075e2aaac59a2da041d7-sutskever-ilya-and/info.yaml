abstract: 'Deep and recurrent neural networks (DNNs and RNNs respectively) are powerful
  models that were considered to be almost impossible to train using stochastic gradient
  descent with momentum. In this paper, we show that when stochastic gradient descent
  with momentum uses a well-designed random initialization and a particular type of
  slowly increasing schedule for the momentum parameter, it can train both DNNs and
  RNNs (on datasets with long-term dependencies) to levels of performance that were
  previously achievable only with Hessian-Free optimization. We find that both the
  initialization and the momentum are crucial since poorly initialized networks cannot
  be trained with momentum and well-initialized networks perform markedly worse when
  the momentum is absent or poorly tuned.     Our success training these models suggests
  that previous attempts to train deep and recurrent neural networks from random initializations
  have likely failed due to poor initialization schemes. Furthermore, carefully tuned
  momentum methods suffice for dealing with the curvature issues in deep and recurrent
  network training objectives without the need for sophisticated second-order methods.   '
