abstract: Prime implicates and prime implicants have proven relevant to a number of
  areas of artificial intelligence, most notably abductive reasoning and knowledge
  compilation. The purpose of this paper is to examine how these notions might be
  appropriately extended from propositional logic to the modal logic K. We begin the
  paper by considering a number of potential definitions of clauses and terms for
  K. The different definitions are evaluated with respect to a set of syntactic, semantic,
  and complexity-theoretic properties characteristic of the propositional definition.
  We then compare the definitions with respect to the properties of the notions of
  prime implicates and prime implicants that they induce. While there is no definition
  that perfectly generalizes the propositional notions, we show that there does exist
  one definition which satisfies many of the desirable properties of the propositional
  case. In the second half of the paper, we consider the computational properties
  of the selected definition. To this end, we provide sound and complete algorithms
  for generating and recognizing prime implicates, and we show the prime implicate
  recognition task to be PSPACE-complete. We also prove upper and lower bounds on
  the size and number of prime implicates. While the paper focuses on the logic K,
  all of our results hold equally well for multi-modal K and for concept expressions
  in the description logic ALC.
