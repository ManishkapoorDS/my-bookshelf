abstract: The ability to record and replay program executions with low overhead enables
  many applications, such as reverse-execution debugging, debugging of hard-to-reproduce
  test failures, and "black box" forensic analysis of failures in deployed systems.
  Existing record-and-replay approaches limit deployability by recording an entire
  virtual machine (heavyweight), modifying the OS kernel (adding deployment and maintenance
  costs), requiring pervasive code instrumentation (imposing significant performance
  and complexity overhead), or modifying compilers and runtime systems (limiting generality).
  We investigated whether it is possible to build a practical record-and-replay system
  avoiding all these issues. The answer turns out to be yes - if the CPU and operating
  system meet certain non-obvious constraints. Fortunately modern Intel CPUs, Linux
  kernels and user-space frameworks do meet these constraints, although this has only
  become true recently. With some novel optimizations, our system 'rr' records and
  replays real-world low-parallelism workloads with low overhead, with an entirely
  user-space implementation, using stock hardware, compilers, runtimes and operating
  systems. "rr" forms the basis of an open-source reverse-execution debugger seeing
  significant use in practice. We present the design and implementation of 'rr', describe
  its performance on a variety of workloads, and identify constraints on hardware
  and operating system design required to support our approach.
