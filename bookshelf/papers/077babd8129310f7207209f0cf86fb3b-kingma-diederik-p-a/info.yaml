abstract: How can we perform efficient inference and learning in directed probabilistic
  models, in the presence of continuous latent variables with intractable posterior
  distributions, and large datasets? We introduce a stochastic variational inference
  and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability
  conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is two-fold. First,
  we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower
  bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic
  gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent
  variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by
  fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the
  intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages
  are reflected in experimental results.
