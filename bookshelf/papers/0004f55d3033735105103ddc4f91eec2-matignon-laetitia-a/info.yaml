abstract: '<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In the framework of fully cooperative
  multi-agent systems, independent (non-communicative) agents that learn by reinforcement
  must overcome several difficulties to manage to coordinate. This paper identifies
  several challenges responsible for the non-coordination of independent agents: Pareto-selection,
  non-stationarity, stochasticity, alter-exploration and shadowed equilibria. A selection
  of multi-agent domains is classified according to those challenges: matrix games,
  Boutilier''s coordination game, predators pursuit domains and a special multi-state
  game. Moreover, the performance of a range of algorithms for independent reinforcement
  learners is evaluated empirically. Those algorithms are Q-learning variants: decentralized
  Q-learning, distributed Q-learning, hysteretic Q-learning, recursive frequency maximum
  Q-value and win-or-learn fast policy hill climbing. An overview of the learning
  algorithms’ strengths and weaknesses against each challenge concludes the paper
  and can serve as a basis for choosing the appropriate algorithm for a new domain.
  Furthermore, the distilled challenges may assist in the design of new learning algorithms
  that overcome these problems and achieve higher performance in multi-agent applications.</jats:p>'
