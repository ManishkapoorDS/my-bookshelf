abstract: Interpretable machine learning tackles the important problem that humans
  cannot understand the behaviors of complex machine learning models and how these
  models arrive at a particular decision. Although many approaches have been proposed,
  a comprehensive understanding of the achievements and challenges is still lacking.
  We provide a survey covering existing techniques to increase the interpretability
  of machine learning models. We also discuss crucial issues that the community should
  consider in future work such as designing user-friendly explanations and developing
  comprehensive evaluation metrics to further push forward the area of interpretable
  machine learning.
