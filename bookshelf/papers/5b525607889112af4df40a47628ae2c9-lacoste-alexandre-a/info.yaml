abstract: 'From an environmental standpoint, there are a few crucial aspects of training
  a neural network that have a major impact on the quantity of carbon that it emits.
  These factors include: the location of the server used for training and the energy
  grid that it uses, the length of the training procedure, and even the make and model
  of hardware on which the training takes place. In order to approximate these emissions,
  we present our Machine Learning Emissions Calculator, a tool for our community to
  better understand the environmental impact of training ML models. We accompany this
  tool with an explanation of the factors cited above, as well as concrete actions
  that individual practitioners and organizations can take to mitigate their carbon
  emissions.'
