abstract: 'This report summarizes the tutorial presented by the author at NIPS 2016
  on generative adversarial networks (GANs). The tutorial describes: (1) Why generative
  modeling is a topic worth studying, (2) how generative models work, and how GANs
  compare to other generative models, (3) the details of how GANs work, (4) research
  frontiers in GANs, and (5) state-of-the-art image models that combine GANs with
  other methods. Finally, the tutorial contains three exercises for readers to complete,
  and the solutions to these exercises.'
