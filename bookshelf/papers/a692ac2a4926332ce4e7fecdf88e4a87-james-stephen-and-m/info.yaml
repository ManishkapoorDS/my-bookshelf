abstract: 'We present a challenging new benchmark and learning-environment for robot
  learning: RLBench. The benchmark features 100 completely unique, hand-designed tasks
  ranging in difficulty, from simple target reaching and door opening, to longer multi-stage
  tasks, such as opening an oven and placing a tray in it. We provide an array of
  both proprioceptive observations and visual observations, which include rgb, depth,
  and segmentation masks from an over-the-shoulder stereo camera and an eye-in-hand
  monocular camera. Uniquely, each task comes with an infinite supply of demos through
  the use of motion planners operating on a series of waypoints given during task
  creation time; enabling an exciting flurry of demonstration-based learning. RLBench
  has been designed with scalability in mind; new tasks, along with their motion-planned
  demos, can be easily created and then verified by a series of tools, allowing users
  to submit their own tasks to the RLBench task repository. This large-scale benchmark
  aims to accelerate progress in a number of vision-guided manipulation research areas,
  including: reinforcement learning, imitation learning, multi-task learning, geometric
  computer vision, and in particular, few-shot learning. With the benchmark''s breadth
  of tasks and demonstrations, we propose the first large-scale few-shot challenge
  in robotics. We hope that the scale and diversity of RLBench offers unparalleled
  research opportunities in the robot learning community and beyond.'
