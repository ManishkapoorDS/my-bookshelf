abstract: This paper outlines the results of sentence level linguistics based rules
  for improving part-of-speech tagging. It is well known that the performance of complex
  NLP systems is negatively affected if one of the preliminary stages is less than
  perfect. Errors in the initial stages in the pipeline have a snowballing effect
  on the pipeline's end performance. We have created a set of linguistics based rules
  at the sentence level which adjust part-of-speech tags from state-of-the-art taggers.
  Comparison with state-of-the-art taggers on widely used benchmarks demonstrate significant
  improvements in tagging accuracy and consequently in the quality and accuracy of
  NLP systems.
