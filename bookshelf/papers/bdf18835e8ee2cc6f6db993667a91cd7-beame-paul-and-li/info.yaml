abstract: The best current methods for exactly computing the number of satisfying
  assignments, or the satisfying probability, of Boolean formulas can be seen, either
  directly or indirectly, as building 'decision-DNNF' (decision decomposable negation
  normal form) representations of the input Boolean formulas. Decision-DNNFs are a
  special case of 'd-DNNF's where 'd' stands for 'deterministic'. We show that any
  decision-DNNF can be converted into an equivalent 'FBDD' (free binary decision diagram)
  -- also known as a 'read-once branching program' (ROBP or 1-BP) -- with only a quasipolynomial
  increase in representation size in general, and with only a polynomial increase
  in size in the special case of monotone k-DNF formulas. Leveraging known exponential
  lower bounds for FBDDs, we then obtain similar exponential lower bounds for decision-DNNFs
  which provide lower bounds for the recent algorithms. We also separate the power
  of decision-DNNFs from d-DNNFs and a generalization of decision-DNNFs known as AND-FBDDs.
  Finally we show how these imply exponential lower bounds for natural problems associated
  with probabilistic databases.
