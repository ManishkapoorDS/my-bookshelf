abstract: <jats:p>Decomposition is a general principle in computational thinking,
  aiming at decomposing a problem instance into easier subproblems. Indeed, decomposing
  a transition system into a partitioned transition relation was critical to scaling
  BDD-based model checking to large state spaces. Since then, it has become a standard
  technique for dealing with related problems, such as Boolean synthesis. More recently,
  partitioning has begun to be explored in the synthesis of reactive systems. LTLf
  synthesis, a finite-horizon version of reactive synthesis with applications in areas
  such as robotics, seems like a promising candidate for partitioning techniques.
  After all, the state of the art is based on a BDD-based symbolic algorithm similar
  to those from model checking, and partitioning could be a potential solution to
  the current bottleneck of this approach, which is the construction of the state
  space. In this work, however, we expose fundamental limitations of partitioning
  that hinder its effective application to symbolic LTLf synthesis. We not only provide
  evidence for this fact through an extensive experimental evaluation, but also perform
  an in-depth analysis to identify the reason for these results. We trace the issue
  to an overall increase in the size of the explored state space, caused by an inability
  of partitioning to fully exploit state-space minimization, which has a crucial effect
  on performance. We conclude that more specialized decomposition techniques are needed
  for LTLf synthesis which take into account the effects of minimization.</jats:p>
