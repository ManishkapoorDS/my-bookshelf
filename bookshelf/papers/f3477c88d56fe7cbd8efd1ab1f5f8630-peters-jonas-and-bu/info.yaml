abstract: 'What is the difference of a prediction that is made with a causal model
  and a non-causal model? Suppose we intervene on the predictor variables or change
  the whole environment. The predictions from a causal model will in general work
  as well under interventions as for observational data. In contrast, predictions
  from a non-causal model can potentially be very wrong if we actively intervene on
  variables. Here, we propose to exploit this invariance of a prediction under a causal
  model for causal inference: given different experimental settings (for example various
  interventions) we collect all models that do show invariance in their predictive
  accuracy across settings and interventions. The causal model will be a member of
  this set of models with high probability. This approach yields valid confidence
  intervals for the causal relationships in quite general scenarios. We examine the
  example of structural equation models in more detail and provide sufficient assumptions
  under which the set of causal predictors becomes identifiable. We further investigate
  robustness properties of our approach under model misspecification and discuss possible
  extensions. The empirical properties are studied for various data sets, including
  large-scale gene perturbation experiments.'
