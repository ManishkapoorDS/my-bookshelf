abstract: Humans spend a remarkable fraction of waking life engaged in acts of "mental
  time travel". We dwell on our actions in the past and experience satisfaction or
  regret. More than merely autobiographical storytelling, we use these event recollections
  to change how we will act in similar scenarios in the future. This process endows
  us with a computationally important ability to link actions and consequences across
  long spans of time, which figures prominently in addressing the problem of long-term
  temporal credit assignment; in artificial intelligence (AI) this is the question
  of how to evaluate the utility of the actions within a long-duration behavioral
  sequence leading to success or failure in a task. Existing approaches to shorter-term
  credit assignment in AI cannot solve tasks with long delays between actions and
  consequences. Here, we introduce a new paradigm for reinforcement learning where
  agents use recall of specific memories to credit actions from the past, allowing
  them to solve problems that are intractable for existing algorithms. This paradigm
  broadens the scope of problems that can be investigated in AI and offers a mechanistic
  account of behaviors that may inspire computational models in neuroscience, psychology,
  and behavioral economics.
