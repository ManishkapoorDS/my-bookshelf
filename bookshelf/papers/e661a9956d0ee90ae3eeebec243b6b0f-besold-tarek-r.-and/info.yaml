abstract: 'The study and understanding of human behaviour is relevant to computer
  science, artificial intelligence, neural computation, cognitive science, philosophy,
  psychology, and several other areas. Presupposing cognition as basis of behaviour,
  among the most prominent tools in the modelling of behaviour are computational-logic
  systems, connectionist models of cognition, and models of uncertainty. Recent studies
  in cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and psychology have produced a number
  of cognitive models of reasoning, learning, and language that are underpinned by
  computation. In addition, efforts in computer science research have led to the development
  of cognitive computational systems integrating machine learning and automated reasoning.
  Such systems have shown promise in a range of applications, including computational
  biology, fault diagnosis, training and assessment in simulators, and software verification.
  This joint survey reviews the personal ideas and views of several researchers on
  neural-symbolic learning and reasoning. The article is organised in three parts:
  Firstly, we frame the scope and goals of neural-symbolic computation and have a
  look at the theoretical foundations. We then proceed to describe the realisations
  of neural-symbolic computation, systems, and applications. Finally we present the
  challenges facing the area and avenues for further research.'
