abstract: We consider the problem of function estimation in the case where an underlying
  causal model can be inferred. This has implications for popular scenarios such as
  covariate shift, concept drift, transfer learning and semi-supervised learning.
  We argue that causal knowledge may facilitate some approaches for a given problem,
  and rule out others. In particular, we formulate a hypothesis for when semi-supervised
  learning can help, and corroborate it with empirical results.
