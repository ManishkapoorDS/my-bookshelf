abstract: We propose a new General Game Playing (GGP) language called Regular Boardgames
  (RBG), which is based on the theory of regular languages. The objective of RBG is
  to join key properties as expressiveness, efficiency, and naturalness of the description
  in one GGP formalism, compensating certain drawbacks of the existing languages.
  This often makes RBG more suitable for various research and practical developments
  in GGP. While dedicated mostly for describing board games, RBG is universal for
  the class of all finite deterministic turn-based games with perfect information.
  We establish foundations of RBG, and analyze it theoretically and experimentally,
  focusing on the efficiency of reasoning. Regular Boardgames is the first GGP language
  that allows efficient encoding and playing games with complex rules and with large
  branching factor (e.g.\ amazons, arimaa, large chess variants, go, international
  checkers, paper soccer).
