abstract: 'Meta-learning algorithms use past experience to learn to quickly solve
  new tasks. In the context of reinforcement learning, meta-learning algorithms acquire
  reinforcement learning procedures to solve new problems more efficiently by utilizing
  experience from prior tasks. The performance of meta-learning algorithms depends
  on the tasks available for meta-training: in the same way that supervised learning
  generalizes best to test points drawn from the same distribution as the training
  points, meta-learning methods generalize best to tasks from the same distribution
  as the meta-training tasks. In effect, meta-reinforcement learning offloads the
  design burden from algorithm design to task design. If we can automate the process
  of task design as well, we can devise a meta-learning algorithm that is truly automated.
  In this work, we take a step in this direction, proposing a family of unsupervised
  meta-learning algorithms for reinforcement learning. We motivate and describe a
  general recipe for unsupervised meta-reinforcement learning, and present an instantiation
  of this approach. Our conceptual and theoretical contributions consist of formulating
  the unsupervised meta-reinforcement learning problem and describing how task proposals
  based on mutual information can be used to train optimal meta-learners. Our experimental
  results indicate that unsupervised meta-reinforcement learning effectively acquires
  accelerated reinforcement learning procedures without the need for manual task design
  and these procedures exceed the performance of learning from scratch.'
