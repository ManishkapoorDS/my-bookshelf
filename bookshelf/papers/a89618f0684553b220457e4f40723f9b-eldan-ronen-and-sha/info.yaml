abstract: We show that there is a simple (approximately radial) function on $\reals^d$,
  expressible by a small 3-layer feedforward neural networks, which cannot be approximated
  by any 2-layer network, to more than a certain constant accuracy, unless its width
  is exponential in the dimension. The result holds for virtually all known activation
  functions, including rectified linear units, sigmoids and thresholds, and formally
  demonstrates that depth -- even if increased by 1 -- can be exponentially more valuable
  than width for standard feedforward neural networks. Moreover, compared to related
  results in the context of Boolean functions, our result requires fewer assumptions,
  and the proof techniques and construction are very different.
