abstract: DeepMind Lab is a first-person 3D game platform designed for research and
  development of general artificial intelligence and machine learning systems. DeepMind
  Lab can be used to study how autonomous artificial agents may learn complex tasks
  in large, partially observed, and visually diverse worlds. DeepMind Lab has a simple
  and flexible API enabling creative task-designs and novel AI-designs to be explored
  and quickly iterated upon. It is powered by a fast and widely recognised game engine,
  and tailored for effective use by the research community.
