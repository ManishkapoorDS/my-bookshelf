abstract: Spectral methods propose new and elegant solutions in probabilistic grammatical
  inference. We propose two ways to improve them. We show how a linear representation,
  or equivalently a weighted automata, output by the spectral learning algorithm can
  be taken as an initial point for the Baum Welch algorithm, in order to increase
  the likelihood of the observation data. Secondly, we show how the inference problem
  can naturally be expressed in the framework of Structured Low-Rank Approximation.
  Both ideas are tested on a benchmark extracted from the PAutomaC challenge.
