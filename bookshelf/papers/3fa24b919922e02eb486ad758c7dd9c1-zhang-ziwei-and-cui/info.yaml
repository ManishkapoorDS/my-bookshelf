abstract: 'Deep learning has been shown successful in a number of domains, ranging
  from acoustics, images to natural language processing. However, applying deep learning
  to the ubiquitous graph data is non-trivial because of the unique characteristics
  of graphs. Recently, a significant amount of research efforts have been devoted
  to this area, greatly advancing graph analyzing techniques. In this survey, we comprehensively
  review different kinds of deep learning methods applied to graphs. We divide existing
  methods into five categories based on their model architectures: Graph Recurrent
  Neural Networks, Graph Convolutional Networks, Graph Autoencoders, Graph Reinforcement
  Learning, and Graph Adversarial Methods. We then provide a comprehensive overview
  of these methods in a systematic manner mainly following their history of developments.
  We also analyze the differences and compositionality of different architectures.
  Finally, we briefly outline their applications and discuss potential future directions.'
