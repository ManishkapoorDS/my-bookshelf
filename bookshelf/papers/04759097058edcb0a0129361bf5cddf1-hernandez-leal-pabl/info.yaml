abstract: 'The key challenge in multiagent learning is learning a best response to
  the behaviour of other agents, which may be non-stationary: if the other agents
  adapt their strategy as well, the learning target moves. Disparate streams of research
  have approached non-stationarity from several angles, which make a variety of implicit
  assumptions that make it hard to keep an overview of the state of the art and to
  validate the innovation and significance of new works. This survey presents a coherent
  overview of work that addresses opponent-induced non-stationarity with tools from
  game theory, reinforcement learning and multi-armed bandits. Further, we reflect
  on the principle approaches how algorithms model and cope with this non-stationarity,
  arriving at a new framework and five categories (in increasing order of sophistication):
  ignore, forget, respond to target models, learn models, and theory of mind. A wide
  range of state-of-the-art algorithms is classified into a taxonomy, using these
  categories and key characteristics of the environment (e.g., observability) and
  adaptation behaviour of the opponents (e.g., smooth, abrupt). To clarify even further
  we present illustrative variations of one domain, contrasting the strengths and
  limitations of each category. Finally, we discuss in which environments the different
  approaches yield most merit, and point to promising avenues of future research.'
