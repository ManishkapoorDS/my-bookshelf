abstract: 'This paper deals with the technology transfer activities of the main public
  research institution in Italy, the Italian Research Council, CNR. A comparative
  analysis on patenting and licensing performances between CNR and the Massachusetts
  Institute of Technology, MIT has been carried out. Findings show that: research
  expenses being equal, CNR patents are 26% of MIT''s; and, patents being equal, CNR
  licenses are also 26% of MIT''s. This means that CNR impact on domestic competitiveness,
  in terms of patent licenses, is less than 7% of MIT''s. Moreover, while 83% of CNR
  patents are never licensed to domestic industry, the Italian technology balance
  of payments shows a perennial deficit. The paper concludes with the identification
  of the possible causes that may explain such a gap.'
