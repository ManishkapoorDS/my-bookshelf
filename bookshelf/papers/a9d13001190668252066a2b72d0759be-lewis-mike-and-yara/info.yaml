abstract: Much of human dialogue occurs in semi-cooperative settings, where agents
  with different goals attempt to agree on common decisions. Negotiations require
  complex communication and reasoning skills, but success is easy to measure, making
  this an interesting task for AI. We gather a large dataset of human-human negotiations
  on a multi-issue bargaining task, where agents who cannot observe each other's reward
  functions must reach an agreement (or a deal) via natural language dialogue. For
  the first time, we show it is possible to train end-to-end models for negotiation,
  which must learn both linguistic and reasoning skills with no annotated dialogue
  states. We also introduce dialogue rollouts, in which the model plans ahead by simulating
  possible complete continuations of the conversation, and find that this technique
  dramatically improves performance. Our code and dataset are publicly available (https://github.com/facebookresearch/end-to-end-negotiator).
