abstract: Deep reinforcement learning is poised to revolutionise the field of AI and
  represents a step towards building autonomous systems with a higher level understanding
  of the visual world. Currently, deep learning is enabling reinforcement learning
  to scale to problems that were previously intractable, such as learning to play
  video games directly from pixels. Deep reinforcement learning algorithms are also
  applied to robotics, allowing control policies for robots to be learned directly
  from camera inputs in the real world. In this survey, we begin with an introduction
  to the general field of reinforcement learning, then progress to the main streams
  of value-based and policy-based methods. Our survey will cover central algorithms
  in deep reinforcement learning, including the deep $Q$-network, trust region policy
  optimisation, and asynchronous advantage actor-critic. In parallel, we highlight
  the unique advantages of deep neural networks, focusing on visual understanding
  via reinforcement learning. To conclude, we describe several current areas of research
  within the field.
