abstract: We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands
  for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language
  representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations
  from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all
  layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one
  additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks,
  such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific
  architecture modifications.   BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful.
  It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks,
  including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI
  accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test
  F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1
  point absolute improvement).
