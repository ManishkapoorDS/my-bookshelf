abstract: 'In recent years there have been many successes of using deep representations
  in reinforcement learning. Still, many of these applications use conventional architectures,
  such as convolutional networks, LSTMs, or auto-encoders. In this paper, we present
  a new neural network architecture for model-free reinforcement learning. Our dueling
  network represents two separate estimators: one for the state value function and
  one for the state-dependent action advantage function. The main benefit of this
  factoring is to generalize learning across actions without imposing any change to
  the underlying reinforcement learning algorithm. Our results show that this architecture
  leads to better policy evaluation in the presence of many similar-valued actions.
  Moreover, the dueling architecture enables our RL agent to outperform the state-of-the-art
  on the Atari 2600 domain.'
