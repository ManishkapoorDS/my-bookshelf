abstract: This paper surveys the field of reinforcement learning from a computer-science
  perspective. It is written to be accessible to researchers familiar with machine
  learning. Both the historical basis of the field and a broad selection of current
  work are summarized. Reinforcement learning is the problem faced by an agent that
  learns behavior through trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment.
  The work described here has a resemblance to work in psychology, but differs considerably
  in the details and in the use of the word ``reinforcement.'' The paper discusses
  central issues of reinforcement learning, including trading off exploration and
  exploitation, establishing the foundations of the field via Markov decision theory,
  learning from delayed reinforcement, constructing empirical models to accelerate
  learning, making use of generalization and hierarchy, and coping with hidden state.
  It concludes with a survey of some implemented systems and an assessment of the
  practical utility of current methods for reinforcement learning.
