abstract: 'Several variants of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture for
  recurrent neural networks have been proposed since its inception in 1995. In recent
  years, these networks have become the state-of-the-art models for a variety of machine
  learning problems. This has led to a renewed interest in understanding the role
  and utility of various computational components of typical LSTM variants. In this
  paper, we present the first large-scale analysis of eight LSTM variants on three
  representative tasks: speech recognition, handwriting recognition, and polyphonic
  music modeling. The hyperparameters of all LSTM variants for each task were optimized
  separately using random search, and their importance was assessed using the powerful
  fANOVA framework. In total, we summarize the results of 5400 experimental runs ($\approx
  15$ years of CPU time), which makes our study the largest of its kind on LSTM networks.
  Our results show that none of the variants can improve upon the standard LSTM architecture
  significantly, and demonstrate the forget gate and the output activation function
  to be its most critical components. We further observe that the studied hyperparameters
  are virtually independent and derive guidelines for their efficient adjustment.'
