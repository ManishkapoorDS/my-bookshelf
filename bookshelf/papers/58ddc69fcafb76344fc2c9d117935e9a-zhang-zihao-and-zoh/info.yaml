abstract: We adopt deep learning models to directly optimise the portfolio Sharpe
  ratio. The framework we present circumvents the requirements for forecasting expected
  returns and allows us to directly optimise portfolio weights by updating model parameters.
  Instead of selecting individual assets, we trade Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) of
  market indices to form a portfolio. Indices of different asset classes show robust
  correlations and trading them substantially reduces the spectrum of available assets
  to choose from. We compare our method with a wide range of algorithms with results
  showing that our model obtains the best performance over the testing period, from
  2011 to the end of April 2020, including the financial instabilities of the first
  quarter of 2020. A sensitivity analysis is included to understand the relevance
  of input features and we further study the performance of our approach under different
  cost rates and different risk levels via volatility scaling.
