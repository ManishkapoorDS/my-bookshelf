abstract: Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) systems have seen extensive study for more
  than two decades, yet we lack a principled strategy for testing BFT implementations.
  This paper presents Twins, a new approach for testing BFT systems. The main idea
  of Twins is that we can emulate Byzantine behavior by running two (or generally
  up to $k$) instances of a node with the same identity. Each of the two instances
  (or Twins) runs unmodified, correct code.   The Twins approach requires only a thin
  network wrapper that delivers messages to/from both Twins. To the rest of the system,
  the Twins appear indistinguishable from a single node behaving in a `questionable'
  manner.   Twins generates `interesting' Byzantine behaviors, including equivocation,
  double voting, and losing internal state, while forgoing `uninteresting' behaviors
  that are trivially rejected by honest nodes, such as producing semantically invalid
  messages. Building on this idea, Twins can systematically generate Byzantine attack
  scenarios at scale, execute them in a controlled manner, and check for desired protocol
  properties.   The paper demonstrates that Twins successfully reinstates several
  famous attacks on BFT protocols. In all cases, protocols break within fewer than
  a dozen protocol steps, hence it is realistic for the Twins approach to expose the
  problems. In two of these attacks, it took the community more than a decade to discover
  protocol flaws that Twins would have surfaced within minutes. Additionally, Twins
  testing was successfully incorporated into a production setting in which Twins executed
  3M Twins-generated scenarios, and exposed (self-injected) subtle safety bugs within
  minutes of testing.
