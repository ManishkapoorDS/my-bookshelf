abstract: Prime compilation, i.e., the generation of all prime implicates or implicants
  (primes for short) of formulae, is a prominent fundamental issue for AI. Recently,
  the prime compilation for non-clausal formulae has received great attention. The
  state-of-the-art approaches generate all primes along with a prime cover constructed
  by prime implicates using dual rail encoding. However, the dual rail encoding potentially
  expands search space. In addition, constructing a prime cover, which is necessary
  for their methods, is time-consuming. To address these issues, we propose a novel
  two-phase method -- CoAPI. The two phases are the key to construct a cover without
  using dual rail encoding. Specifically, given a non-clausal formula, we first propose
  a core-guided method to rewrite the non-clausal formula into a cover constructed
  by over-approximate implicates in the first phase. Then, we generate all the primes
  based on the cover in the second phase. In order to reduce the size of the cover,
  we provide a multi-order based shrinking method, with a good tradeoff between the
  small size and efficiency, to compress the size of cover considerably. The experimental
  results show that CoAPI outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Particularly, for
  generating all prime implicates, CoAPI consumes about one order of magnitude less
  time.
