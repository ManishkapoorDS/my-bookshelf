abstract: While classical planning has been an active branch of AI, its applicability
  is limited to the tasks precisely modeled by humans. Fully automated high-level
  agents should be instead able to find a symbolic representation of an unknown environment
  without supervision, otherwise it exhibits the knowledge acquisition bottleneck.
  Meanwhile, Latplan (Asai and Fukunaga 2018) partially resolves the bottleneck with
  a neural network called State AutoEncoder (SAE). SAE obtains the propositional representation
  of the image-based puzzle domains with unsupervised learning, generates a state
  space and performs classical planning. In this paper, we identify the problematic,
  stochastic behavior of the SAE-produced propositions as a new sub-problem of symbol
  grounding problem, the symbol stability problem. Informally, symbols are stable
  when their referents (e.g. propositional values) do not change against small perturbation
  of the observation, and unstable symbols are harmful for symbolic reasoning. We
  analyze the problem in Latplan both formally and empirically, and propose "Zero-Suppressed
  SAE", an enhancement that stabilizes the propositions using the idea of closed-world
  assumption as a prior for NN optimization. We show that it finds the more stable
  propositions and the more compact representations, resulting in an improved success
  rate of Latplan. It is robust against various hyperparameters and eases the tuning
  effort, and also provides a weight pruning capability as a side effect.
