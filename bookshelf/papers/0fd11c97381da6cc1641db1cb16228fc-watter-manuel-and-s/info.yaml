abstract: We introduce Embed to Control (E2C), a method for model learning and control
  of non-linear dynamical systems from raw pixel images. E2C consists of a deep generative
  model, belonging to the family of variational autoencoders, that learns to generate
  image trajectories from a latent space in which the dynamics is constrained to be
  locally linear. Our model is derived directly from an optimal control formulation
  in latent space, supports long-term prediction of image sequences and exhibits strong
  performance on a variety of complex control problems.
