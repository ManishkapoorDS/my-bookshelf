abstract: This paper shows how Long Short-term Memory recurrent neural networks can
  be used to generate complex sequences with long-range structure, simply by predicting
  one data point at a time. The approach is demonstrated for text (where the data
  are discrete) and online handwriting (where the data are real-valued). It is then
  extended to handwriting synthesis by allowing the network to condition its predictions
  on a text sequence. The resulting system is able to generate highly realistic cursive
  handwriting in a wide variety of styles.
