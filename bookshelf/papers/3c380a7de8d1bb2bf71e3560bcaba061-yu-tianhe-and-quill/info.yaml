abstract: Meta-reinforcement learning algorithms can enable robots to acquire new
  skills much more quickly, by leveraging prior experience to learn how to learn.
  However, much of the current research on meta-reinforcement learning focuses on
  task distributions that are very narrow. For example, a commonly used meta-reinforcement
  learning benchmark uses different running velocities for a simulated robot as different
  tasks. When policies are meta-trained on such narrow task distributions, they cannot
  possibly generalize to more quickly acquire entirely new tasks. Therefore, if the
  aim of these methods is to enable faster acquisition of entirely new behaviors,
  we must evaluate them on task distributions that are sufficiently broad to enable
  generalization to new behaviors. In this paper, we propose an open-source simulated
  benchmark for meta-reinforcement learning and multi-task learning consisting of
  50 distinct robotic manipulation tasks. Our aim is to make it possible to develop
  algorithms that generalize to accelerate the acquisition of entirely new, held-out
  tasks. We evaluate 6 state-of-the-art meta-reinforcement learning and multi-task
  learning algorithms on these tasks. Surprisingly, while each task and its variations
  (e.g., with different object positions) can be learned with reasonable success,
  these algorithms struggle to learn with multiple tasks at the same time, even with
  as few as ten distinct training tasks. Our analysis and open-source environments
  pave the way for future research in multi-task learning and meta-learning that can
  enable meaningful generalization, thereby unlocking the full potential of these
  methods.
