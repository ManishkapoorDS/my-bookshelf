abstract: A blockchain-based smart contract or a "smart contract" for short, is a
  computer program intended to digitally facilitate the negotiation or contractual
  terms directly between users when certain conditions are met. With the advance in
  blockchain technology, smart contracts are being used to serve a wide range of purposes
  ranging from self-managed identities on public blockchains to automating business
  collaboration on permissioned blockchains. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
  survey of smart contracts with a focus on existing applications and challenges they
  face.
