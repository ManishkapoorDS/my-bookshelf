abstract: In this work we investigate on the concept of "restraining bolt", envisioned
  in Science Fiction. Specifically we introduce a novel problem in AI. We have two
  distinct sets of features extracted from the world, one by the agent and one by
  the authority imposing restraining specifications (the "restraining bolt"). The
  two sets are apparently unrelated since of interest to independent parties, however
  they both account for (aspects of) the same world. We consider the case in which
  the agent is a reinforcement learning agent on the first set of features, while
  the restraining bolt is specified logically using linear time logic on finite traces
  LTLf/LDLf over the second set of features. We show formally, and illustrate with
  examples, that, under general circumstances, the agent can learn while shaping its
  goals to suitably conform (as much as possible) to the restraining bolt specifications.
