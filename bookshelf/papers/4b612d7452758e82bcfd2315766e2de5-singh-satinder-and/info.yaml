abstract: Modeling dynamical systems, both for control purposes and to make predictions
  about their behavior, is ubiquitous in science and engineering. Predictive state
  representations (PSRs) are a recently introduced class of models for discrete-time
  dynamical systems. The key idea behind PSRs and the closely related OOMs (Jaeger's
  observable operator models) is to represent the state of the system as a set of
  predictions of observable outcomes of experiments one can do in the system. This
  makes PSRs rather different from history-based models such as nth-order Markov models
  and hidden-state-based models such as HMMs and POMDPs. We introduce an interesting
  construct, the systemdynamics matrix, and show how PSRs can be derived simply from
  it. We also use this construct to show formally that PSRs are more general than
  both nth-order Markov models and HMMs/POMDPs. Finally, we discuss the main difference
  between PSRs and OOMs and conclude with directions for future work.
