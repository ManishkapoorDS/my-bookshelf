abstract: <jats:p>We study planning for LTLf and LDLf temporally extended goals in
  nondeterministic fully observable domains (FOND). We consider both strong and strong
  cyclic plans, and develop foundational automata-based techniques to deal with both
  cases. Â Using these techniques we provide the computational characterization of
  both problems, separating the complexity in the size of the domain specification
  from that in the size of the formula. Specifically we establish them to be EXPTIME-complete
  and 2EXPTIME-complete, respectively, for both problems. In doing so, we also show
  2EXPTIME-hardness for strong cyclic plans, which was open.</jats:p>
