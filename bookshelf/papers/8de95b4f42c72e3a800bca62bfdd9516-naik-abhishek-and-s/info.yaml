abstract: Discounted reinforcement learning is fundamentally incompatible with function
  approximation for control in continuing tasks. It is not an optimization problem
  in its usual formulation, so when using function approximation there is no optimal
  policy. We substantiate these claims, then go on to address some misconceptions
  about discounting and its connection to the average reward formulation. We encourage
  researchers to adopt rigorous optimization approaches, such as maximizing average
  reward, for reinforcement learning in continuing tasks.
