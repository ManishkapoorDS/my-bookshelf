abstract: 'We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial
  process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that
  captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the
  probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training
  procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework
  corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G
  and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution
  and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer
  perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no
  need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either
  training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the
  framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.'
