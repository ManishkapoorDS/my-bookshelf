abstract: This paper addresses the visualisation of image classification models, learnt
  using deep Convolutional Networks (ConvNets). We consider two visualisation techniques,
  based on computing the gradient of the class score with respect to the input image.
  The first one generates an image, which maximises the class score [Erhan et al.,
  2009], thus visualising the notion of the class, captured by a ConvNet. The second
  technique computes a class saliency map, specific to a given image and class. We
  show that such maps can be employed for weakly supervised object segmentation using
  classification ConvNets. Finally, we establish the connection between the gradient-based
  ConvNet visualisation methods and deconvolutional networks [Zeiler et al., 2013].
