abstract: Graphical causal inference as pioneered by Judea Pearl arose from research
  on artificial intelligence (AI), and for a long time had little connection to the
  field of machine learning.   This article discusses where links have been and should
  be established, introducing key concepts along the way. It argues that the hard
  open problems of machine learning and AI are intrinsically related to causality,
  and explains how the field is beginning to understand them.
