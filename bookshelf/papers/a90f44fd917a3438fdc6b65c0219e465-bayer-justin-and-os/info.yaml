abstract: Leveraging advances in variational inference, we propose to enhance recurrent
  neural networks with latent variables, resulting in Stochastic Recurrent Networks
  (STORNs). The model i) can be trained with stochastic gradient methods, ii) allows
  structured and multi-modal conditionals at each time step, iii) features a reliable
  estimator of the marginal likelihood and iv) is a generalisation of deterministic
  recurrent neural networks. We evaluate the method on four polyphonic musical data
  sets and motion capture data.
