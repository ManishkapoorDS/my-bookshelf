abstract: <jats:p>In Reinforcement Learning (RL), an agent is guided by the rewards
  it receives from the reward function. Unfortunately, it may take many interactions
  with the environment to learn from sparse rewards, and it can be challenging to
  specify reward functions that reflect complex reward-worthy behavior. We propose
  using reward machines (RMs), which are automata-based representations that expose
  reward function structure, as a normal form representation for reward functions.
  We show how specifications of reward in various formal languages, including LTL
  and other regular languages, can be automatically translated into RMs, easing the
  burden of complex reward function specification. We then show how the exposed structure
  of the reward function can be exploited by tailored q-learning algorithms and automated
  reward shaping techniques in order to improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement
  learning methods. Experiments show that these RM-tailored techniques significantly
  outperform state-of-the-art (deep) RL algorithms, solving problems that otherwise
  cannot reasonably be solved by existing approaches.</jats:p>
