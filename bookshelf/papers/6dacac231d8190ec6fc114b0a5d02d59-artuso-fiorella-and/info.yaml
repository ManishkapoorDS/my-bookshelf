abstract: In this paper we investigate the problem of automatically naming pieces
  of assembly code. Where by naming we mean assigning to portion of code the string
  of words that would be likely assigned by an human reverse engineer. We precisely
  define the framework in which our investigation takes place. That is we define problem,
  we provide reasonable justifications for the choice that we made during our designing
  of the training and test steps and we performed a statistical analysis of function
  names in a large real-world corpora of over 4 millions of functions. In such framework
  we test several baselines coming from the field of NLP.
