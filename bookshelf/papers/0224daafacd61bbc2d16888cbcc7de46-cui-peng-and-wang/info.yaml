abstract: Network embedding assigns nodes in a network to low-dimensional representations
  and effectively preserves the network structure. Recently, a significant amount
  of progresses have been made toward this emerging network analysis paradigm. In
  this survey, we focus on categorizing and then reviewing the current development
  on network embedding methods, and point out its future research directions. We first
  summarize the motivation of network embedding. We discuss the classical graph embedding
  algorithms and their relationship with network embedding. Afterwards and primarily,
  we provide a comprehensive overview of a large number of network embedding methods
  in a systematic manner, covering the structure- and property-preserving network
  embedding methods, the network embedding methods with side information and the advanced
  information preserving network embedding methods. Moreover, several evaluation approaches
  for network embedding and some useful online resources, including the network data
  sets and softwares, are reviewed, too. Finally, we discuss the framework of exploiting
  these network embedding methods to build an effective system and point out some
  potential future directions.
