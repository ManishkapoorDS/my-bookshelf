abstract: The game of chess is the most widely-studied domain in the history of artificial
  intelligence. The strongest programs are based on a combination of sophisticated
  search techniques, domain-specific adaptations, and handcrafted evaluation functions
  that have been refined by human experts over several decades. In contrast, the AlphaGo
  Zero program recently achieved superhuman performance in the game of Go, by tabula
  rasa reinforcement learning from games of self-play. In this paper, we generalise
  this approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm that can achieve, tabula rasa, superhuman
  performance in many challenging domains. Starting from random play, and given no
  domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero achieved within 24 hours a superhuman
  level of play in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess) as well as Go, and
  convincingly defeated a world-champion program in each case.
