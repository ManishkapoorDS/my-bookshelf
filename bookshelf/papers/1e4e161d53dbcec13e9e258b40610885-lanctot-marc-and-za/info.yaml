abstract: 'To achieve general intelligence, agents must learn how to interact with
  others in a shared environment: this is the challenge of multiagent reinforcement
  learning (MARL). The simplest form is independent reinforcement learning (InRL),
  where each agent treats its experience as part of its (non-stationary) environment.
  In this paper, we first observe that policies learned using InRL can overfit to
  the other agents'' policies during training, failing to sufficiently generalize
  during execution. We introduce a new metric, joint-policy correlation, to quantify
  this effect. We describe an algorithm for general MARL, based on approximate best
  responses to mixtures of policies generated using deep reinforcement learning, and
  empirical game-theoretic analysis to compute meta-strategies for policy selection.
  The algorithm generalizes previous ones such as InRL, iterated best response, double
  oracle, and fictitious play. Then, we present a scalable implementation which reduces
  the memory requirement using decoupled meta-solvers. Finally, we demonstrate the
  generality of the resulting policies in two partially observable settings: gridworld
  coordination games and poker.'
