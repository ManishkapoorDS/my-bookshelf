abstract: We study a new type of K-armed bandit problem where the expected return
  of one arm may depend on the returns of other arms. We present a new algorithm for
  this general class of problems and show that under certain circumstances it is possible
  to achieve finite expected cumulative regret. We also give problem-dependent lower
  bounds on the cumulative regret showing that at least in special cases the new algorithm
  is nearly optimal.
