abstract: '<jats:p>The classical filtering and prediction problem is re-examined using
  the Bode-Shannon representation of random processes and the “state-transition” method
  of analysis of dynamic systems. New results are: (1) The formulation and methods
  of solution of the problem apply without modification to stationary and nonstationary
  statistics and to growing-memory and infinite-memory filters. (2) A nonlinear difference
  (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation
  error. From the solution of this equation the co-efficients of the difference (or
  differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are obtained without further
  calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free
  regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems,
  confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained
  and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes
  are reviewed in the Appendix.</jats:p>'
