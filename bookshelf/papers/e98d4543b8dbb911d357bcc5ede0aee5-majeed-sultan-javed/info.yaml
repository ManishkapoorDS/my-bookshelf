abstract: '<jats:p>Temporal-difference (TD) learning is an attractive, computationally
  efficient framework for model- free reinforcement learning. Q-learning is one of
  the most widely used TD learning technique that enables an agent to learn the optimal
  action-value function, i.e. Q-value function. Contrary to its widespread use, Q-learning
  has only been proven to converge on Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Q-uniform
  abstractions of finite-state MDPs. On the other hand, most real-world problems are
  inherently non-Markovian: the full true state of the environment is not revealed
  by recent observations. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of Q-learning
  when applied to non-MDP and non-ergodic domains which may have infinitely many underlying
  states. We prove that the convergence guarantee of Q-learning can be extended to
  a class of such non-MDP problems, in particular, to some non-stationary domains.
  We show that state-uniformity of the optimal Q-value function is a necessary and
  sufficient condition for Q-learning to converge even in the case of infinitely many
  internal states.</jats:p>'
