abstract: 'Large Convolutional Network models have recently demonstrated impressive
  classification performance on the ImageNet benchmark. However there is no clear
  understanding of why they perform so well, or how they might be improved. In this
  paper we address both issues. We introduce a novel visualization technique that
  gives insight into the function of intermediate feature layers and the operation
  of the classifier. We also perform an ablation study to discover the performance
  contribution from different model layers. This enables us to find model architectures
  that outperform Krizhevsky \etal on the ImageNet classification benchmark. We show
  our ImageNet model generalizes well to other datasets: when the softmax classifier
  is retrained, it convincingly beats the current state-of-the-art results on Caltech-101
  and Caltech-256 datasets.'
