abstract: 'This paper presents an algorithm for enumerating biases in word embeddings.
  The algorithm exposes a large number of offensive associations related to sensitive
  features such as race and gender on publicly available embeddings, including a supposedly
  "debiased" embedding. These biases are concerning in light of the widespread use
  of word embeddings. The associations are identified by geometric patterns in word
  embeddings that run parallel between people''s names and common lower-case tokens.
  The algorithm is highly unsupervised: it does not even require the sensitive features
  to be pre-specified. This is desirable because: (a) many forms of discrimination--such
  as racial discrimination--are linked to social constructs that may vary depending
  on the context, rather than to categories with fixed definitions; and (b) it makes
  it easier to identify biases against intersectional groups, which depend on combinations
  of sensitive features. The inputs to our algorithm are a list of target tokens,
  e.g. names, and a word embedding. It outputs a number of Word Embedding Association
  Tests (WEATs) that capture various biases present in the data. We illustrate the
  utility of our approach on publicly available word embeddings and lists of names,
  and evaluate its output using crowdsourcing. We also show how removing names may
  not remove potential proxy bias.'
