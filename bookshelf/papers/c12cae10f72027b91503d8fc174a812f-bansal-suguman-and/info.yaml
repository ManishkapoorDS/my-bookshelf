abstract: 'LTLf synthesis is the automated construction of a reactive system from
  a high-level description, expressed in LTLf, of its finite-horizon behavior. So
  far, the conversion of LTLf formulas to deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs)
  has been identified as the primary bottleneck to the scalabity of synthesis. Recent
  investigations have also shown that the size of the DFA state space plays a critical
  role in synthesis as well.   Therefore, effective resolution of the bottleneck for
  synthesis requires the conversion to be time and memory performant, and prevent
  state-space explosion. Current conversion approaches, however, which are based either
  on explicit-state representation or symbolic-state representation, fail to address
  these necessities adequately at scale: Explicit-state approaches generate minimal
  DFA but are slow due to expensive DFA minimization. Symbolic-state representations
  can be succinct, but due to the lack of DFA minimization they generate such large
  state spaces that even their symbolic representations cannot compensate for the
  blow-up.   This work proposes a hybrid representation approach for the conversion.
  Our approach utilizes both explicit and symbolic representations of the state-space,
  and effectively leverages their complementary strengths. In doing so, we offer an
  LTLf to DFA conversion technique that addresses all three necessities, hence resolving
  the bottleneck. A comprehensive empirical evaluation on conversion and synthesis
  benchmarks supports the merits of our hybrid approach.'
