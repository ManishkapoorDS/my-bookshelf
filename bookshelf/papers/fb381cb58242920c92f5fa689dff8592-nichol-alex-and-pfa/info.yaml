abstract: In this report, we present a new reinforcement learning (RL) benchmark based
  on the Sonic the Hedgehog (TM) video game franchise. This benchmark is intended
  to measure the performance of transfer learning and few-shot learning algorithms
  in the RL domain. We also present and evaluate some baseline algorithms on the new
  benchmark.
