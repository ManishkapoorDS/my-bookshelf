abstract: Deep learning techniques have made tremendous progress in a variety of challenging
  tasks, such as image recognition and machine translation, during the past decade.
  Training deep neural networks is computationally expensive and requires both human
  and intellectual resources. Therefore, it is necessary to protect the intellectual
  property of the model and externally verify the ownership of the model. However,
  previous studies either fail to defend against the evasion attack or have not explicitly
  dealt with fraudulent claims of ownership by adversaries. Furthermore, they can
  not establish a clear association between the model and the creator's identity.   To
  fill these gaps, in this paper, we propose a novel intellectual property protection
  (IPP) framework based on blind-watermark for watermarking deep neural networks that
  meet the requirements of security and feasibility. Our framework accepts ordinary
  samples and the exclusive logo as inputs, outputting newly generated samples as
  watermarks, which are almost indistinguishable from the origin, and infuses these
  watermarks into DNN models by assigning specific labels, leaving the backdoor as
  the basis for our copyright claim. We evaluated our IPP framework on two benchmark
  datasets and 15 popular deep learning models. The results show that our framework
  successfully verifies the ownership of all the models without a noticeable impact
  on their primary task. Most importantly, we are the first to successfully design
  and implement a blind-watermark based framework, which can achieve state-of-art
  performances on undetectability against evasion attack and unforgeability against
  fraudulent claims of ownership. Further, our framework shows remarkable robustness
  and establishes a clear association between the model and the author's identity.
