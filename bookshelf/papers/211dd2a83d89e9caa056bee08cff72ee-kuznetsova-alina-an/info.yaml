abstract: 'We present Open Images V4, a dataset of 9.2M images with unified annotations
  for image classification, object detection and visual relationship detection. The
  images have a Creative Commons Attribution license that allows to share and adapt
  the material, and they have been collected from Flickr without a predefined list
  of class names or tags, leading to natural class statistics and avoiding an initial
  design bias. Open Images V4 offers large scale across several dimensions: 30.1M
  image-level labels for 19.8k concepts, 15.4M bounding boxes for 600 object classes,
  and 375k visual relationship annotations involving 57 classes. For object detection
  in particular, we provide 15x more bounding boxes than the next largest datasets
  (15.4M boxes on 1.9M images). The images often show complex scenes with several
  objects (8 annotated objects per image on average). We annotated visual relationships
  between them, which support visual relationship detection, an emerging task that
  requires structured reasoning. We provide in-depth comprehensive statistics about
  the dataset, we validate the quality of the annotations, we study how the performance
  of several modern models evolves with increasing amounts of training data, and we
  demonstrate two applications made possible by having unified annotations of multiple
  types coexisting in the same images. We hope that the scale, quality, and variety
  of Open Images V4 will foster further research and innovation even beyond the areas
  of image classification, object detection, and visual relationship detection.'
