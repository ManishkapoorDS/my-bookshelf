abstract: Translating formulas of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) over finite traces,
  or LTLf, to symbolic Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) plays an important role
  not only in LTLf synthesis, but also in synthesis for Safety LTL formulas. The translation
  is enabled by using MONA, a powerful tool for symbolic, BDD-based, DFA construction
  from logic specifications. Recent works used a first-order encoding of LTLf formulas
  to translate LTLf to First Order Logic (FOL), which is then fed to MONA to get the
  symbolic DFA. This encoding was shown to perform well, but other encodings have
  not been studied. Specifically, the natural question of whether second-order encoding,
  which has significantly simpler quantificational structure, can outperform first-order
  encoding remained open.   In this paper we address this challenge and study second-order
  encodings for LTLf formulas. We first introduce a specific MSO encoding that captures
  the semantics of LTLf in a natural way and prove its correctness. We then explore
  is a Compact MSO encoding, which benefits from automata-theoretic minimization,
  thus suggesting a possible practical advantage. To that end, we propose a formalization
  of symbolic DFA in second-order logic, thus developing a novel connection between
  BDDs and MSO. We then show by empirical evaluations that the first-order encoding
  does perform better than both second-order encodings. The conclusion is that first-order
  encoding is a better choice than second-order encoding in LTLf-to-Automata translation.
