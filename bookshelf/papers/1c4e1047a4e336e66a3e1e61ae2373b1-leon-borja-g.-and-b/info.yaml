abstract: The combination of Formal Methods with Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently
  attracted interest as a way for single-agent RL to learn multiple-task specifications.
  In this paper we extend this convergence to multi-agent settings and formally define
  Extended Markov Games as a general mathematical model that allows multiple RL agents
  to concurrently learn various non-Markovian specifications. To introduce this new
  model we provide formal definitions and proofs as well as empirical tests of RL
  algorithms running on this framework. Specifically, we use our model to train two
  different logic-based multi-agent RL algorithms to solve diverse settings of non-Markovian
  co-safe LTL specifications.
