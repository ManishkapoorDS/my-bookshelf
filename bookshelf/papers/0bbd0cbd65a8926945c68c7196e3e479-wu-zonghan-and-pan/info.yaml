abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized many machine learning tasks in recent years,
  ranging from image classification and video processing to speech recognition and
  natural language understanding. The data in these tasks are typically represented
  in the Euclidean space. However, there is an increasing number of applications where
  data are generated from non-Euclidean domains and are represented as graphs with
  complex relationships and interdependency between objects. The complexity of graph
  data has imposed significant challenges on existing machine learning algorithms.
  Recently, many studies on extending deep learning approaches for graph data have
  emerged. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks
  (GNNs) in data mining and machine learning fields. We propose a new taxonomy to
  divide the state-of-the-art graph neural networks into four categories, namely recurrent
  graph neural networks, convolutional graph neural networks, graph autoencoders,
  and spatial-temporal graph neural networks. We further discuss the applications
  of graph neural networks across various domains and summarize the open source codes,
  benchmark data sets, and model evaluation of graph neural networks. Finally, we
  propose potential research directions in this rapidly growing field.
