abstract: 'Solomonoff unified Occam''s razor and Epicurus'' principle of multiple
  explanations to one elegant, formal, universal theory of inductive inference, which
  initiated the field of algorithmic information theory. His central result is that
  the posterior of his universal semimeasure M converges rapidly to the true sequence
  generating posterior mu, if the latter is computable. Hence, M is eligible as a
  universal predictor in case of unknown mu. We investigate the existence and convergence
  of computable universal (semi)measures for a hierarchy of computability classes:
  finitely computable, estimable, enumerable, and approximable. For instance, M is
  known to be enumerable, but not finitely computable, and to dominate all enumerable
  semimeasures. We define seven classes of (semi)measures based on these four computability
  concepts. Each class may or may not contain a (semi)measure which dominates all
  elements of another class. The analysis of these 49 cases can be reduced to four
  basic cases, two of them being new. The results hold for discrete and continuous
  semimeasures. We also investigate more closely the types of convergence, possibly
  implied by universality: in difference and in ratio, with probability 1, in mean
  sum, and for Martin-Loef random sequences. We introduce a generalized concept of
  randomness for individual sequences and use it to exhibit difficulties regarding
  these issues.'
