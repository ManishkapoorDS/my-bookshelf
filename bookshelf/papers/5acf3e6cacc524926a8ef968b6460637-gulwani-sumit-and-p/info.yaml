abstract: 'Program synthesis is the task of automatically ﬁnding a program in the
  underlying programming language that satisﬁes the user intent expressed in the form
  of some speciﬁcation. Since the inception of AI in the 1950s, this problem has been
  considered the holy grail of Computer Science. Despite inherent challenges in the
  problem such as ambiguity of user intent and a typically enormous search space of
  programs, the ﬁeld of program synthesis has developed many diﬀerent techniques that
  enable program synthesis in diﬀerent real-life application domains. It is now used
  successfully in software engineering, biological discovery, computer-aided education,
  end-user programming, and data cleaning. In the last decade, several applications
  of synthesis in the ﬁeld of programming by examples have been deployed in mass-market
  industrial products. This survey is a general overview of the state-of-the-art approaches
  to program synthesis, its applications, and subﬁelds. We discuss the general principles
  common to all modern synthesis approaches such as syntactic bias, oracle-guided
  inductive search, and optimization techniques. We then present a literature review
  covering the four most common state-of-the-art techniques in program synthesis:
  enumerative search, constraint solving, stochastic search, and deduction-based programming
  by examples. We conclude with a brief list of future horizons for the ﬁeld.'
