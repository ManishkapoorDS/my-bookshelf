abstract: 'Image representations, from SIFT and Bag of Visual Words to Convolutional
  Neural Networks (CNNs), are a crucial component of almost any image understanding
  system. Nevertheless, our understanding of them remains limited. In this paper we
  conduct a direct analysis of the visual information contained in representations
  by asking the following question: given an encoding of an image, to which extent
  is it possible to reconstruct the image itself? To answer this question we contribute
  a general framework to invert representations. We show that this method can invert
  representations such as HOG and SIFT more accurately than recent alternatives while
  being applicable to CNNs too. We then use this technique to study the inverse of
  recent state-of-the-art CNN image representations for the first time. Among our
  findings, we show that several layers in CNNs retain photographically accurate information
  about the image, with different degrees of geometric and photometric invariance.'
