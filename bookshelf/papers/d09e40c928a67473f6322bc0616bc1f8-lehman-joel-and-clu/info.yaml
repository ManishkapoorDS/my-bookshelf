abstract: Biological evolution provides a creative fount of complex and subtle adaptations,
  often surprising the scientists who discover them. However, because evolution is
  an algorithmic process that transcends the substrate in which it occurs, evolution's
  creativity is not limited to nature. Indeed, many researchers in the field of digital
  evolution have observed their evolving algorithms and organisms subverting their
  intentions, exposing unrecognized bugs in their code, producing unexpected adaptations,
  or exhibiting outcomes uncannily convergent with ones in nature. Such stories routinely
  reveal creativity by evolution in these digital worlds, but they rarely fit into
  the standard scientific narrative. Instead they are often treated as mere obstacles
  to be overcome, rather than results that warrant study in their own right. The stories
  themselves are traded among researchers through oral tradition, but that mode of
  information transmission is inefficient and prone to error and outright loss. Moreover,
  the fact that these stories tend to be shared only among practitioners means that
  many natural scientists do not realize how interesting and lifelike digital organisms
  are and how natural their evolution can be. To our knowledge, no collection of such
  anecdotes has been published before. This paper is the crowd-sourced product of
  researchers in the fields of artificial life and evolutionary computation who have
  provided first-hand accounts of such cases. It thus serves as a written, fact-checked
  collection of scientifically important and even entertaining stories. In doing so
  we also present here substantial evidence that the existence and importance of evolutionary
  surprises extends beyond the natural world, and may indeed be a universal property
  of all complex evolving systems.
