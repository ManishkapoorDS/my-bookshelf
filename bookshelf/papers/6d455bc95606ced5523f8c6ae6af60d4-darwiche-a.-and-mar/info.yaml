abstract: 'We propose a perspective on knowledge compilation which calls for analyzing
  different compilation approaches according to two key dimensions: the succinctness
  of the target compilation language, and the class of queries and transformations
  that the language supports in polytime. We then provide a knowledge compilation
  map, which analyzes a large number of existing target compilation languages according
  to their succinctness and their polytime transformations and queries. We argue that
  such analysis is necessary for placing new compilation approaches within the context
  of existing ones. We also go beyond classical, flat target compilation languages
  based on CNF and DNF, and consider a richer, nested class based on directed acyclic
  graphs (such as OBDDs), which we show to include a relatively large number of target
  compilation languages.'
