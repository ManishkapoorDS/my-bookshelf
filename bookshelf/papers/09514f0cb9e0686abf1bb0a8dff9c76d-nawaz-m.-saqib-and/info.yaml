abstract: 'Mechanical reasoning is a key area of research that lies at the crossroads
  of mathematical logic and artificial intelligence. The main aim to develop mechanical
  reasoning systems (also known as theorem provers) was to enable mathematicians to
  prove theorems by computer programs. However, these tools evolved with time and
  now play vital role in the modeling and reasoning about complex and large-scale
  systems, especially safety-critical systems. Technically, mathematical formalisms
  and automated reasoning based-approaches are employed to perform inferences and
  to generate proofs in theorem provers. In literature, there is a shortage of comprehensive
  documents that can provide proper guidance about the preferences of theorem provers
  with respect to their designs, performances, logical frameworks, strengths, differences
  and their application areas. In this work, more than 40 theorem provers are studied
  in detail and compared to present a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of these
  tools. Theorem provers are investigated based on various parameters, which includes:
  implementation architecture, logic and calculus used, library support, level of
  automation, programming paradigm, programming language, differences and application
  areas.'
