abstract: We present GQSAT, a branching heuristic in a Boolean SAT solver trained
  with value-based reinforcement learning (RL) using Graph Neural Networks for function
  approximation. Solvers using GQSAT are complete SAT solvers that either provide
  a satisfying assignment or a proof of unsatisfiability, which is required for many
  SAT applications. The branching heuristic commonly used in SAT solvers today suffers
  from bad decisions during their warm-up period, whereas GQSAT has been trained to
  examine the structure of the particular problem instance to make better decisions
  at the beginning of the search. Training GQSAT is data efficient and does not require
  elaborate dataset preparation or feature engineering to train. We train GQSAT on
  small SAT problems using RL interfacing with an existing SAT solver. We show that
  GQSAT is able to reduce the number of iterations required to solve SAT problems
  by 2-3X, and it generalizes to unsatisfiable SAT instances, as well as to problems
  with 5X more variables than it was trained on. We also show that, to a lesser extent,
  it generalizes to SAT problems from different domains by evaluating it on graph
  coloring. Our experiments show that augmenting SAT solvers with agents trained with
  RL and graph neural networks can improve performance on the SAT search problem.
