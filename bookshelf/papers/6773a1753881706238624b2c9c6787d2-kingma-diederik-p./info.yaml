abstract: The ever-increasing size of modern data sets combined with the difficulty
  of obtaining label information has made semi-supervised learning one of the problems
  of significant practical importance in modern data analysis. We revisit the approach
  to semi-supervised learning with generative models and develop new models that allow
  for effective generalisation from small labelled data sets to large unlabelled ones.
  Generative approaches have thus far been either inflexible, inefficient or non-scalable.
  We show that deep generative models and approximate Bayesian inference exploiting
  recent advances in variational methods can be used to provide significant improvements,
  making generative approaches highly competitive for semi-supervised learning.
