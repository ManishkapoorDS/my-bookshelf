abstract: In this paper, we propose and investigate a new neural network architecture
  called Neural Random Access Machine. It can manipulate and dereference pointers
  to an external variable-size random-access memory. The model is trained from pure
  input-output examples using backpropagation.   We evaluate the new model on a number
  of simple algorithmic tasks whose solutions require pointer manipulation and dereferencing.
  Our results show that the proposed model can learn to solve algorithmic tasks of
  such type and is capable of operating on simple data structures like linked-lists
  and binary trees. For easier tasks, the learned solutions generalize to sequences
  of arbitrary length. Moreover, memory access during inference can be done in a constant
  time under some assumptions.
