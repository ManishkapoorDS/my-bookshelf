abstract: In a celebrated work by Hoeffding [J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 58 (1963) 13-30],
  several inequalities for tail probabilities of sums M_n=X_1+... +X_n of bounded
  independent random variables X_j were proved. These inequalities had a considerable
  impact on the development of probability and statistics, and remained unimproved
  until 1995 when Talagrand [Inst. Hautes Etudes Sci. Publ. Math. 81 (1995a) 73-205]
  inserted certain missing factors in the bounds of two theorems. By similar factors,
  a third theorem was refined by Pinelis [Progress in Probability 43 (1998) 257-314]
  and refined (and extended) by me. In this article, I introduce a new type of inequality.   Namely,
  I show that P{M_n\geq x}\leq cP{S_n\geq x}, where c is an absolute constant and
  S_n=\epsilon_1+... +\epsilon_n is a sum of independent identically distributed Bernoulli
  random variables (a random variable is called Bernoulli if it assumes at most two
  values). The inequality holds for those x\in R where the survival function x\mapsto
  P{S_n\geq x} has a jump down. For the remaining x the inequality still holds provided
  that the function between the adjacent jump points is interpolated linearly or \log-linearly.
  If it is necessary, to estimate P{S_n\geq x} special bounds can be used for binomial
  probabilities. The results extend to martingales with bounded differences. It is
  apparent that Theorem 1.1 of this article is the most important.
