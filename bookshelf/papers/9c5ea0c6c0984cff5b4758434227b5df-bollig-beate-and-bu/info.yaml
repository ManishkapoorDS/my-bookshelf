abstract: Sentential decision diagrams (SDDs) introduced by Darwiche in 2011 are a
  promising representation type used in knowledge compilation. The relative succinctness
  of representation types is an important subject in this area. The aim of the paper
  is to identify which kind of Boolean functions can be represented by SDDs of small
  size with respect to the number of variables the functions are defined on. For this
  reason the sets of Boolean functions representable by different representation types
  in polynomial size are investigated and SDDs are compared with representation types
  from the classical knowledge compilation map of Darwiche and Marquis. Ordered binary
  decision diagrams (OBDDs) which are a popular data structure for Boolean functions
  are one of these representation types. SDDs are more general than OBDDs by definition
  but only recently, a Boolean function was presented with polynomial SDD size but
  exponential OBDD size. This result is strengthened in several ways. The main result
  is a quasipolynomial simulation of SDDs by equivalent unambiguous nondeterministic
  OBDDs, a nondeterministic variant where there exists exactly one accepting computation
  for each satisfying input. As a side effect an open problem about the relative succinctness
  between SDDs and free binary decision diagrams (FBDDs) which are more general than
  OBDDs is answered.
