abstract: We detail a new framework for privacy preserving deep learning and discuss
  its assets. The framework puts a premium on ownership and secure processing of data
  and introduces a valuable representation based on chains of commands and tensors.
  This abstraction allows one to implement complex privacy preserving constructs such
  as Federated Learning, Secure Multiparty Computation, and Differential Privacy while
  still exposing a familiar deep learning API to the end-user. We report early results
  on the Boston Housing and Pima Indian Diabetes datasets. While the privacy features
  apart from Differential Privacy do not impact the prediction accuracy, the current
  implementation of the framework introduces a significant overhead in performance,
  which will be addressed at a later stage of the development. We believe this work
  is an important milestone introducing the first reliable, general framework for
  privacy preserving deep learning.
