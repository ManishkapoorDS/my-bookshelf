abstract: This document investigates the integration of adaptive distinguishing sequences
  into the process of active automata learning (AAL). A novel AAL algorithm "ADT"
  (adaptive discrimination tree) is developed and presented. Since the submission
  of the original thesis, the presented algorithm has been integrated into LearnLib
  - an open-source library for active automata learning - and has been successfully
  used in related fields of research.
