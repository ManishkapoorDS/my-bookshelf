abstract: 'This paper presents LEXR, a framework for explaining the decision making
  of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) using a formal description language called Linear
  Temporal Logic (LTL). LTL is the de facto standard for the specification of temporal
  properties in the context of formal verification and features many desirable properties
  that make the generated explanations easy for humans to interpret: it is a descriptive
  language, it has a variable-free syntax, and it can easily be translated into plain
  English. To generate explanations, LEXR follows the principle of counterexample-guided
  inductive synthesis and combines Valiant''s probably approximately correct learning
  (PAC) with constraint solving. We prove that LEXR''s explanations satisfy the PAC
  guarantee (provided the RNN can be described by LTL) and show empirically that these
  explanations are more accurate and easier-to-understand than the ones generated
  by recent algorithms that extract deterministic finite automata from RNNs.'
