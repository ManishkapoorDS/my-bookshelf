abstract: 'This book is an invitation to discover advanced topics in category theory
  through concrete, real-world examples. It aims to give a tour: a gentle, quick introduction
  to guide later exploration. The tour takes place over seven sketches, each pairing
  an evocative application, such as databases, electric circuits, or dynamical systems,
  with the exploration of a categorical structure, such as adjoint functors, enriched
  categories, or toposes.   No prior knowledge of category theory is assumed.   A
  feedback form for typos, comments, questions, and suggestions is available here:
