abstract: The DeepMind Control Suite is a set of continuous control tasks with a standardised
  structure and interpretable rewards, intended to serve as performance benchmarks
  for reinforcement learning agents. The tasks are written in Python and powered by
  the MuJoCo physics engine, making them easy to use and modify. We include benchmarks
  for several learning algorithms. The Control Suite is publicly available at https://www.github.com/deepmind/dm_control
  . A video summary of all tasks is available at http://youtu.be/rAai4QzcYbs .
