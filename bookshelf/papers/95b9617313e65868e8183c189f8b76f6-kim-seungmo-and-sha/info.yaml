abstract: The concern on human health is often overseen while wearable technologies
  attract exploding interests. Mainly due to the extreme proximity or a direct physical
  contact to the human skin, wearable communications devices are acknowledged to cause
  higher levels of specific absorption rate (SAR) at the skin surface. Unfortunately,
  so far, we have found no study encompassing all the aspects that the general public
  needs to understand about wearable technologies--i.e., the analytical and experimental
  backgrounds, and report of SAR levels generated from commercial wearable devices.
  In this context, this paper provides an extensive review on SAR from various commercial
  wearable devices that are currently sold in the market, as well as the analytical
  framework and the current measurement methodologies for standard compliance tests.
  Moreover, considering the present interest in millimeter wave (mmW), this paper
  sheds light on the SAR evaluated at 60 GHz and also compares the SAR to that measured
  at 2.4 GHz. We expect that this paper will be of value in informing the general
  public of the safety in using the currently sold wearable devices, and in igniting
  further study of the exact biological consequences from electromagnetic field (EMF)
  exposure due to wearable devices.
