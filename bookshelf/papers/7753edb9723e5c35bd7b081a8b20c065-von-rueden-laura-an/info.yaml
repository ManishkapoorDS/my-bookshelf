abstract: Despite its great success, machine learning can have its limits when dealing
  with insufficient training data. A potential solution is the additional integration
  of prior knowledge into the training process, which leads to the notion of informed
  machine learning. In this paper, we present a structured overview of various approaches
  in this field. First, we provide a definition and propose a concept for informed
  machine learning, which illustrates its building blocks and distinguishes it from
  conventional machine learning. Second, we introduce a taxonomy that serves as a
  classification framework for informed machine learning approaches. It considers
  the source of knowledge, its representation, and its integration into the machine
  learning pipeline. Third, we survey related research and describe how different
  knowledge representations such as algebraic equations, logic rules, or simulation
  results can be used in learning systems. This evaluation of numerous papers on the
  basis of our taxonomy uncovers key methods in the field of informed machine learning.
