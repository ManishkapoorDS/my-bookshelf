abstract: We offer a graphical interpretation of unfairness in a dataset as the presence
  of an unfair causal path in the causal Bayesian network representing the data-generation
  mechanism. We use this viewpoint to revisit the recent debate surrounding the COMPAS
  pretrial risk assessment tool and, more generally, to point out that fairness evaluation
  on a model requires careful considerations on the patterns of unfairness underlying
  the training data. We show that causal Bayesian networks provide us with a powerful
  tool to measure unfairness in a dataset and to design fair models in complex unfairness
  scenarios.
