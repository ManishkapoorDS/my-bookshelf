abstract: This paper extends the framework of partially observable Markov decision
  processes (POMDPs) to multi-agent settings by incorporating the notion of agent
  models into the state space. Agents maintain beliefs over physical states of the
  environment and over models of other agents, and they use Bayesian updates to maintain
  their beliefs over time. The solutions map belief states to actions. Models of other
  agents may include their belief states and are related to agent types considered
  in games of incomplete information. We express the agents autonomy by postulating
  that their models are not directly manipulable or observable by other agents. We
  show that important properties of POMDPs, such as convergence of value iteration,
  the rate of convergence, and piece-wise linearity and convexity of the value functions
  carry over to our framework. Our approach complements a more traditional approach
  to interactive settings which uses Nash equilibria as a solution paradigm. We seek
  to avoid some of the drawbacks of equilibria which may be non-unique and do not
  capture off-equilibrium behaviors. We do so at the cost of having to represent,
  process and continuously revise models of other agents. Since the agents beliefs
  may be arbitrarily nested, the optimal solutions to decision making problems are
  only asymptotically computable. However, approximate belief updates and approximately
  optimal plans are computable. We illustrate our framework using a simple application
  domain, and we show examples of belief updates and value functions.
