abstract: The Sentential Decision Diagram (SDD) is a prominent knowledge representation
  language that subsumes the Ordered Binary Decision Diagram (OBDD) as a strict subset.
  Like OBDDs, SDDs have canonical forms and support bottom-up operations for combining
  SDDs, but they are more succinct than OBDDs. In this paper we introduce an SDD variant,
  called the Zero-suppressed Sentential Decision Diagram (ZSDD). The key idea of ZSDD
  is to employ new trimming rules for obtaining a canonical form. As a result, ZSDD
  subsumes the Zero-suppressed Binary Decision Diagram (ZDD) as a strict subset. ZDDs
  are known for their effectiveness on representing sparse Boolean functions. Likewise,
  ZSDDs can be more succinct than SDDs when representing sparse Boolean functions.
  We propose several polytime bottom-up operations over ZSDDs, and a technique for
  reducing ZSDD size, while maintaining applicability to important queries. We also
  specify two distinct upper bounds on ZSDD sizes; one is derived from the treewidth
  of a CNF and the other from the size of a family of sets. Experiments show that
  ZSDDs are smaller than SDDs or ZDDs for a standard benchmark dataset.
