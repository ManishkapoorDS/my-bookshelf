abstract: 'We introduce FeUdal Networks (FuNs): a novel architecture for hierarchical
  reinforcement learning. Our approach is inspired by the feudal reinforcement learning
  proposal of Dayan and Hinton, and gains power and efficacy by decoupling end-to-end
  learning across multiple levels -- allowing it to utilise different resolutions
  of time. Our framework employs a Manager module and a Worker module. The Manager
  operates at a lower temporal resolution and sets abstract goals which are conveyed
  to and enacted by the Worker. The Worker generates primitive actions at every tick
  of the environment. The decoupled structure of FuN conveys several benefits -- in
  addition to facilitating very long timescale credit assignment it also encourages
  the emergence of sub-policies associated with different goals set by the Manager.
  These properties allow FuN to dramatically outperform a strong baseline agent on
  tasks that involve long-term credit assignment or memorisation. We demonstrate the
  performance of our proposed system on a range of tasks from the ATARI suite and
  also from a 3D DeepMind Lab environment.'
