abstract: 'We propose a unified neural network architecture and learning algorithm
  that can be applied to various natural language processing tasks including: part-of-speech
  tagging, chunking, named entity recognition, and semantic role labeling. This versatility
  is achieved by trying to avoid task-specific engineering and therefore disregarding
  a lot of prior knowledge. Instead of exploiting man-made input features carefully
  optimized for each task, our system learns internal representations on the basis
  of vast amounts of mostly unlabeled training data. This work is then used as a basis
  for building a freely available tagging system with good performance and minimal
  computational requirements.'
