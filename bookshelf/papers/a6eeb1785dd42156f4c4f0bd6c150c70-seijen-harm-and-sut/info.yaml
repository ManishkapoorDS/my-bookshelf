abstract: TD(lambda) is a core algorithm of modern reinforcement learning. Its appeal
  comes from its equivalence to a clear and conceptually simple forward view, and
  the fact that it can be implemented online in an inexpensive manner. However, the
  equivalence between TD(lambda) and the forward view is exact only for the off-line
  version of the algorithm (in which updates are made only at the end of each episode).
  In the online version of TD(lambda) (in which updates are made at each step, which
  generally performs better and is always used in applications) the match to the forward
  view is only approximate. In a sense this is unavoidable for the conventional forward
  view, as it itself presumes that the estimates are unchanging during an episode.
  In this paper we introduce a new forward view that takes into account the possibility
  of changing estimates and a new variant of TD(lambda) that exactly achieves it.
  Our algorithm uses a new form of eligibility trace similar to but different from
  conventional accumulating and replacing traces. The overall computational complexity
  is the same as TD(lambda), even when using function approximation. In our empirical
  comparisons, our algorithm outperformed TD(lambda) in all of its variations. It
  seems, by adhering more truly to the original goal of TD(lambda)—matching an intuitively
  clear forward view even in the online case—that we have found a new algorithm that
  simply improves on classical TD(lambda).
