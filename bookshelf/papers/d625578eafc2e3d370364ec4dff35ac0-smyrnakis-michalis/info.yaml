abstract: 'Decentralised optimisation tasks are important components of multi-agent
  systems. These tasks can be interpreted as n-player potential games: therefore game-theoretic
  learning algorithms can be used to solve decentralised optimisation tasks. Fictitious
  play is the canonical example of these algorithms. Nevertheless fictitious play
  implicitly assumes that players have stationary strategies. We present a novel variant
  of fictitious play where players predict their opponents'' strategies using Extended
  Kalman filters and use their predictions to update their strategies.   We show that
  in 2 by 2 games with at least one pure Nash equilibrium and in potential games where
  players have two available actions, the proposed algorithm converges to the pure
  Nash equilibrium. The performance of the proposed algorithm was empirically tested,
  in two strategic form games and an ad-hoc sensor network surveillance problem. The
  proposed algorithm performs better than the classic fictitious play algorithm in
  these games and therefore improves the performance of game-theoretical learning
  in decentralised optimisation.'
