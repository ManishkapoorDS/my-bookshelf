abstract: LTLf synthesis is the process of finding a strategy that satisfies a linear
  temporal specification over finite traces. An existing solution to this problem
  relies on a reduction to a DFA game. In this paper, we propose a symbolic framework
  for LTLf synthesis based on this technique, by performing the computation over a
  representation of the DFA as a boolean formula rather than as an explicit graph.
  This approach enables strategy generation by utilizing the mechanism of boolean
  synthesis. We implement this symbolic synthesis method in a tool called Syft, and
  demonstrate by experiments on scalable benchmarks that the symbolic approach scales
  better than the explicit one.
