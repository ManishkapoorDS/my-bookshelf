abstract: 'Intelligent systems based on first-order logic on the one hand, and on
  artificial neural networks (also called connectionist systems) on the other, differ
  substantially. It would be very desirable to combine the robust neural networking
  machinery with symbolic knowledge representation and reasoning paradigms like logic
  programming in such a way that the strengths of either paradigm will be retained.
  Current state-of-the-art research, however, fails by far to achieve this ultimate
  goal. As one of the main obstacles to be overcome we perceive the question how symbolic
  knowledge can be encoded by means of connectionist systems: Satisfactory answers
  to this will naturally lead the way to knowledge extraction algorithms and to integrated
  neural-symbolic systems.'
