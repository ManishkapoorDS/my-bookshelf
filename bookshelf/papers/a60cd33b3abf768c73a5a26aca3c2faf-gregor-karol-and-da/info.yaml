abstract: This paper introduces the Deep Recurrent Attentive Writer (DRAW) neural
  network architecture for image generation. DRAW networks combine a novel spatial
  attention mechanism that mimics the foveation of the human eye, with a sequential
  variational auto-encoding framework that allows for the iterative construction of
  complex images. The system substantially improves on the state of the art for generative
  models on MNIST, and, when trained on the Street View House Numbers dataset, it
  generates images that cannot be distinguished from real data with the naked eye.
