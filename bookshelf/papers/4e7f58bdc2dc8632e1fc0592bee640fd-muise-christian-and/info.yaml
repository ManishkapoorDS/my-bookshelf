abstract: <jats:p>Partial-order plans (POPs) are attractive because of their least-commitment
  nature, which provides enhanced plan flexibility at execution time relative to sequential
  plans. Current research on automated plan generation focuses on producing sequential
  plans, despite the appeal of POPs. In this paper we examine POP generation by relaxing
  or modifying the action orderings of a sequential plan to optimize for plan criteria
  that promote flexibility. Our approach relies on a novel partial weighted MaxSAT
  encoding of a sequential plan that supports the minimization of deordering or reordering
  of actions. Using a similar technique, we further demonstrate how to remove redundant
  actions from the plan, and how to combine this criterion with the objective of maximizing
  a POP's flexibility. Our partial weighted MaxSAT encoding allows us to compute a
  POP from a sequential plan effectively. We compare the efficiency of our approach
  to previous methods for POP generation via sequential-plan relaxation. Our results
  show that while an existing heuristic approach consistently produces the optimal
  deordering of a sequential plan, our approach has greater flexibility when we consider
  reordering the actions in the plan while also providing a guarantee of optimality.
  We also investigate and confirm the accuracy of the standard flex metric typically
  used to predict the true flexibility of a POP as measured by the number of linearizations
  it represents.</jats:p>
