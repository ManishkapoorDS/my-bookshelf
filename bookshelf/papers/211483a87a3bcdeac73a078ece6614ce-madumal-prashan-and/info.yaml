abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) systems need to include an explanation
  model to communicate the internal decisions, behaviours and actions to the interacting
  humans. Successful explanation involves both cognitive and social processes. In
  this paper we focus on the challenge of meaningful interaction between an explainer
  and an explainee and investigate the structural aspects of an interactive explanation
  to propose an interaction protocol. We follow a bottom-up approach to derive the
  model by analysing transcripts of different explanation dialogue types with 398
  explanation dialogues. We use grounded theory to code and identify key components
  of an explanation dialogue. We formalize the model using the agent dialogue framework
  (ADF) as a new dialogue type and then evaluate it in a human-agent interaction study
  with 101 dialogues from 14 participants. Our results show that the proposed model
  can closely follow the explanation dialogues of human-agent conversations.
