abstract: We summarize the papers published by Einstein in the Annalen der Physik
  in the years 1902-04 on the derivation of the properties of thermal equilibrium
  on the basis of the mechanical equations of motion and of the calculus of probabilities.
  We point out the line of thought that led Einstein to an especially economical foundation
  of the discipline, and to focus on fluctuations of the energy as a possible tool
  for establishing the validity of this foundation. We also sketch a comparison of
  Einstein's approach with that of Gibbs, suggesting that although they obtained similar
  results, they had different motivations and interpreted them in very different ways.
