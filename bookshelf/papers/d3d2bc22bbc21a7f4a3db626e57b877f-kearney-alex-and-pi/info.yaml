abstract: 'Within Reinforcement Learning, there is a growing collection of research
  which aims to express all of an agent''s knowledge of the world through predictions
  about sensation, behaviour, and time. This work can be seen not only as a collection
  of architectural proposals, but also as the beginnings of a theory of machine knowledge
  in reinforcement learning. Recent work has expanded what can be expressed using
  predictions, and developed applications which use predictions to inform decision-making
  on a variety of synthetic and real-world problems. While promising, we here suggest
  that the notion of predictions as knowledge in reinforcement learning is as yet
  underdeveloped: some work explicitly refers to predictions as knowledge, what the
  requirements are for considering a prediction to be knowledge have yet to be well
  explored. This specification of the necessary and sufficient conditions of knowledge
  is important; even if claims about the nature of knowledge are left implicit in
  technical proposals, the underlying assumptions of such claims have consequences
  for the systems we design. These consequences manifest in both the way we choose
  to structure predictive knowledge architectures, and how we evaluate them. In this
  paper, we take a first step to formalizing predictive knowledge by discussing the
  relationship of predictive knowledge learning methods to existing theories of knowledge
  in epistemology. Specifically, we explore the relationships between Generalized
  Value Functions and epistemic notions of Justification and Truth.'
