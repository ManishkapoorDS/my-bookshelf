abstract: The brain processes information through many layers of neurons. This deep
  architecture is representationally powerful, but it complicates learning by making
  it hard to identify the responsible neurons when a mistake is made. In machine learning,
  the backpropagation algorithm assigns blame to a neuron by computing exactly how
  it contributed to an error. To do this, it multiplies error signals by matrices
  consisting of all the synaptic weights on the neuron's axon and farther downstream.
  This operation requires a precisely choreographed transport of synaptic weight information,
  which is thought to be impossible in the brain. Here we present a surprisingly simple
  algorithm for deep learning, which assigns blame by multiplying error signals by
  random synaptic weights. We show that a network can learn to extract useful information
  from signals sent through these random feedback connections. In essence, the network
  learns to learn. We demonstrate that this new mechanism performs as quickly and
  accurately as backpropagation on a variety of problems and describe the principles
  which underlie its function. Our demonstration provides a plausible basis for how
  a neuron can be adapted using error signals generated at distal locations in the
  brain, and thus dispels long-held assumptions about the algorithmic constraints
  on learning in neural circuits.
