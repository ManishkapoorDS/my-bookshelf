abstract: We analyze cascades of defaults in an interbank loan market. The novel feature
  of this study is that the network structure and the size distribution of banks are
  derived from empirical data. We find that the ability of a defaulted institution
  to start a cascade depends on an interplay of shock size and connectivity. Further
  results indicate that the ability to limit default risk by spreading the lending
  to many counterparts decreased with the financial crisis. To evaluate the influence
  of the network structure on market stability, we compare the simulated cascades
  from the empirical network with results from different randomized network models.
  The results show that the empirical network has non-random features, which cannot
  be captured by rewired networks. The analysis also reveals that simulations assuming
  homogeneity for size of banks and loan contracts dramatically overestimates the
  fragility of the interbank market.
