abstract: <jats:p>We propose a model of random quantified boolean formulas and their
  natural random disjunctive logic program counterparts. The model extends the standard
  models for random SAT and 2QBF. We provide theoretical bounds for the phase transition
  region in the new model, and show experimentally the presence of the easy-hard-easy
  pattern. Importantly, we show that the model is well suited for assessing solvers
  tuned to real-world instances. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, our model
  and results on random disjunctive logic programs are the first of their kind.</jats:p>
