abstract: '<jats:p>Prompt-LTL extends Linear Temporal Logic with a bounded version
  of the ``eventually'''' operator to express temporal requirements such as bounding
  waiting times.  We study assume-guarantee synthesis for prompt-LTL: the goal is
  to construct a system such that for all environments satisfying a first prompt-LTL
  formula (the assumption) the system composed with this environment satisfies a second
  prompt-LTL formula (the guarantee).  This problem has been open for a decade. We
  construct an algorithm for solving it and show that, like classical LTL synthesis,
  it is 2-EXPTIME-complete.</jats:p>'
