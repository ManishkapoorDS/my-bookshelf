abstract: The powerset construction is a standard method for converting a nondeterministic
  automaton into a deterministic one recognizing the same language. In this paper,
  we lift the powerset construction from automata to the more general framework of
  coalgebras with structured state spaces. Coalgebra is an abstract framework for
  the uniform study of different kinds of dynamical systems. An endofunctor F determines
  both the type of systems (F-coalgebras) and a notion of behavioural equivalence
  (~_F) amongst them. Many types of transition systems and their equivalences can
  be captured by a functor F. For example, for deterministic automata the derived
  equivalence is language equivalence, while for non-deterministic automata it is
  ordinary bisimilarity. We give several examples of applications of our generalized
  determinization construction, including partial Mealy machines, (structured) Moore
  automata, Rabin probabilistic automata, and, somewhat surprisingly, even pushdown
  automata. To further witness the generality of the approach we show how to characterize
  coalgebraically several equivalences which have been object of interest in the concurrency
  community, such as failure or ready semantics.
