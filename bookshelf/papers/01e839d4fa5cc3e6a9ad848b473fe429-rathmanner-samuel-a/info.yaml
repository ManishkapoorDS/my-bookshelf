abstract: Understanding inductive reasoning is a problem that has engaged mankind
  for thousands of years. This problem is relevant to a wide range of fields and is
  integral to the philosophy of science. It has been tackled by many great minds ranging
  from philosophers to scientists to mathematicians, and more recently computer scientists.
  In this article we argue the case for Solomonoff Induction, a formal inductive framework
  which combines algorithmic information theory with the Bayesian framework. Although
  it achieves excellent theoretical results and is based on solid philosophical foundations,
  the requisite technical knowledge necessary for understanding this framework has
  caused it to remain largely unknown and unappreciated in the wider scientific community.
  The main contribution of this article is to convey Solomonoff induction and its
  related concepts in a generally accessible form with the aim of bridging this current
  technical gap. In the process we examine the major historical contributions that
  have led to the formulation of Solomonoff Induction as well as criticisms of Solomonoff
  and induction in general. In particular we examine how Solomonoff induction addresses
  many issues that have plagued other inductive systems, such as the black ravens
  paradox and the confirmation problem, and compare this approach with other recent
  approaches.
