abstract: Recent research in artificial intelligence and machine learning has largely
  emphasized general-purpose learning and ever-larger training sets and more and more
  compute. In contrast, I propose a hybrid, knowledge-driven, reasoning-based approach,
  centered around cognitive models, that could provide the substrate for a richer,
  more robust AI than is currently possible.
