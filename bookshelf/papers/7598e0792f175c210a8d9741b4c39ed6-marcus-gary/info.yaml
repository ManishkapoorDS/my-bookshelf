abstract: Although deep learning has historical roots going back decades, neither
  the term "deep learning" nor the approach was popular just over five years ago,
  when the field was reignited by papers such as Krizhevsky, Sutskever and Hinton's
  now classic (2012) deep network model of Imagenet. What has the field discovered
  in the five subsequent years? Against a background of considerable progress in areas
  such as speech recognition, image recognition, and game playing, and considerable
  enthusiasm in the popular press, I present ten concerns for deep learning, and suggest
  that deep learning must be supplemented by other techniques if we are to reach artificial
  general intelligence.
