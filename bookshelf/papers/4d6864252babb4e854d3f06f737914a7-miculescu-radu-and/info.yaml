abstract: In this paper we prove a generalization of Istr\u{a}\c{t}escu's theorem
  for convex contractions. More precisely, we introduce the concept of iterated function
  system consisting of convex contractions and prove the existence and uniqueness
  of the attractor of such a system. In addition we study the properties of the canonical
  projection from the code space into the attractor of an iterated function system
  consisting of convex contractions.
