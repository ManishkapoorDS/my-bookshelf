abstract: We present the first model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm to
  synthesise policies for an unknown Markov Decision Process (MDP), such that a linear
  time property is satisfied. The given temporal property is converted into a Limit
  Deterministic Buchi Automaton (LDBA) and a robust reward function is defined over
  the state-action pairs of the MDP according to the resulting LDBA. With this reward
  function, the policy synthesis procedure is "constrained" by the given specification.
  These constraints guide the MDP exploration so as to minimize the solution time
  by only considering the portion of the MDP that is relevant to satisfaction of the
  LTL property. This improves performance and scalability of the proposed method by
  avoiding an exhaustive update over the whole state space while the efficiency of
  standard methods such as dynamic programming is hindered by excessive memory requirements,
  caused by the need to store a full-model in memory. Additionally, we show that the
  RL procedure sets up a local value iteration method to efficiently calculate the
  maximum probability of satisfying the given property, at any given state of the
  MDP. We prove that our algorithm is guaranteed to find a policy whose traces probabilistically
  satisfy the LTL property if such a policy exists, and additionally we show that
  our method produces reasonable control policies even when the LTL property cannot
  be satisfied. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated via a set of numerical
  examples. We observe an improvement of one order of magnitude in the number of iterations
  required for the synthesis compared to existing approaches.
