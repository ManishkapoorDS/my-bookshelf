abstract: We argue that chemistry should be the next grand challenge for Artificial
  Intelligence. The AI research community and humanity would benefit tremendously
  from focusing AI research on chemistry on a regular basis, as a benchmark as well
  as a real-world application domain. To support our position, we review the importance
  of chemical compound discovery and synthesis planning and discuss the properties
  of search spaces in a chemistry problem. Knowledge acquired in domains such as two-player
  board games or single-player puzzles places the AI community in a good position
  to solve critical problems in the chemistry domain. Yet, we show that searching
  in chemistry problems poses significant additional challenges that will have to
  be addressed. Finally, we envision how several AI areas like Natural Language Processing,
  Machine Learning, planning and search, are relevant for chemistry.
