abstract: I discuss several aspects of information theory and its relationship to
  physics and neuroscience. The unifying thread of this somewhat chaotic essay is
  the concept of Kolmogorov or algorithmic complexity (Kolmogorov Complexity, for
  short). I argue that it is natural to interpret cognition as the art of finding
  algorithms that apprach the Solomonoff-Kolmogorov-Chaitin (algorithmic) Complexity
  limit with appropriate tradeoffs. In addition, I claim that what we call the universe
  is an interpreted abstraction--a mental construct--based on the observed coherence
  between multiple sensory input streams and our own interactions. Hence, the notion
  of Universe is itself a model.
