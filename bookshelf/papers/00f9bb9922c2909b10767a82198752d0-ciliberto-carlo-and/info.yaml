abstract: Recently, increased computational power and data availability, as well as
  algorithmic advances, have led machine learning techniques to impressive results
  in regression, classification, data-generation and reinforcement learning tasks.
  Despite these successes, the proximity to the physical limits of chip fabrication
  alongside the increasing size of datasets are motivating a growing number of researchers
  to explore the possibility of harnessing the power of quantum computation to speed-up
  classical machine learning algorithms. Here we review the literature in quantum
  machine learning and discuss perspectives for a mixed readership of classical machine
  learning and quantum computation experts. Particular emphasis will be placed on
  clarifying the limitations of quantum algorithms, how they compare with their best
  classical counterparts and why quantum resources are expected to provide advantages
  for learning problems. Learning in the presence of noise and certain computationally
  hard problems in machine learning are identified as promising directions for the
  field. Practical questions, like how to upload classical data into quantum form,
  will also be addressed.
