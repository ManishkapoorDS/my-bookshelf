abstract: Information accounting provides a better foundation for hypothesis testing
  than does uncertainty quantification. A quantitative account of science is derived
  under this perspective that alleviates the need for epistemic bridge principles,
  solves the problem of ad hoc falsification criteria, and deals with verisimilitude
  by facilitating a general approach to process-level diagnostics. Our argument is
  that the well-known inconsistencies of both Bayesian and classical statistical hypothesis
  tests are due to the fact that probability theory is an insufficient logic of science.
  Information theory, as an extension of probability theory, is required to provide
  a complete logic on which to base quantitative theories of empirical learning. The
  organizing question in this case becomes not whether our theories or models are
  more or less true, or about how much uncertainty is associated with a particular
  model, but instead whether there is any information available from experimental
  data that might allow us to improve the model. This becomes a formal hypothesis
  test, provides a theory of model diagnostics, and suggests a new approach to building
  dynamical systems models.
