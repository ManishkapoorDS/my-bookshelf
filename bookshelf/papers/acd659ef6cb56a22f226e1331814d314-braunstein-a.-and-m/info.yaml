abstract: 'We study the satisfiability of randomly generated formulas formed by $M$
  clauses of exactly $K$ literals over $N$ Boolean variables. For a given value of
  $N$ the problem is known to be most difficult with $\alpha=M/N$ close to the experimental
  threshold $\alpha_c$ separating the region where almost all formulas are SAT from
  the region where all formulas are UNSAT. Recent results from a statistical physics
  analysis suggest that the difficulty is related to the existence of a clustering
  phenomenon of the solutions when $\alpha$ is close to (but smaller than) $\alpha_c$.
  We introduce a new type of message passing algorithm which allows to find efficiently
  a satisfiable assignment of the variables in the difficult region. This algorithm
  is iterative and composed of two main parts. The first is a message-passing procedure
  which generalizes the usual methods like Sum-Product or Belief Propagation: it passes
  messages that are surveys over clusters of the ordinary messages. The second part
  uses the detailed probabilistic information obtained from the surveys in order to
  fix variables and simplify the problem. Eventually, the simplified problem that
  remains is solved by a conventional heuristic.'
