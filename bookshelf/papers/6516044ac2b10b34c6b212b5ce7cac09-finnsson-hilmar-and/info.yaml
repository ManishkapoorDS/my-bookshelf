abstract: The aim of General Game Playing (GGP) is to create intelligent agents that
  can automatically learn how to play many different games at an expert level without
  any human intervention. One of the main challenges such agents face is to automatically
  learn knowledge-based heuristics in real-time, whether for evaluating game positions
  or for search guidance. In recent years, GGP agents that use Monte-Carlo simulations
  to reason about their actions have become increasingly more popular. For competitive
  play such an approach requires an effective search-control mechanism for guiding
  the simulation playouts. In here we introduce several schemes for automatically
  learning search guidance based on both statistical and reinforcement learning techniques.
  We compare the different schemes empirically on a variety of games and show that
  they improve significantly upon the current state-of-the-art in simulation-control
  in GGP. For example, in the chesslike game Skirmish, which has proved a particularly
  challenging game for simulation-based GGP agents, an agent employing one of the
  proposed schemes achieves 97% winning rate against an unmodified agent.
