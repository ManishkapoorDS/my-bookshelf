abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been around for decades and
  employed to solve various sequential decision-making problems. These algorithms
  however have faced great challenges when dealing with high-dimensional environments.
  The recent development of deep learning has enabled RL methods to drive optimal
  policies for sophisticated and capable agents, which can perform efficiently in
  these challenging environments. This paper addresses an important aspect of deep
  RL related to situations that require multiple agents to communicate and cooperate
  to solve complex tasks. A survey of different approaches to problems related to
  multi-agent deep RL (MADRL) is presented, including non-stationarity, partial observability,
  continuous state and action spaces, multi-agent training schemes, multi-agent transfer
  learning. The merits and demerits of the reviewed methods will be analyzed and discussed,
  with their corresponding applications explored. It is envisaged that this review
  provides insights about various MADRL methods and can lead to future development
  of more robust and highly useful multi-agent learning methods for solving real-world
  problems.
