abstract: <jats:p>In this work we have investigated the concept of “restraining bolt”,
  inspired by Science Fiction. We have two distinct sets of features extracted from
  the world, one by the agent and one by the authority imposing some restraining specifications
  on the behaviour of the agent (the “restraining bolt”). The two sets of features
  and, hence the model of the world attainable from them, are apparently unrelated
  since of interest to independent parties. However they both account for (aspects
  of) the same world. We have considered the case in which the agent is a reinforcement
  learning agent on a set of low-level (subsymbolic) features, while the restraining
  bolt is specified logically using linear time logic on finite traces f/f over a
  set of high-level symbolic features. We show formally, and illustrate with examples,
  that, under general circumstances, the agent can learn while shaping its goals to
  suitably conform (as much as possible) to the restraining bolt specifications.1</jats:p>
