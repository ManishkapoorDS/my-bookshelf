abstract: This paper investigates the effect of learning a forward model on the performance
  of a statistical forward planning agent. We transform Conway's Game of Life simulation
  into a single-player game where the objective can be either to preserve as much
  life as possible or to extinguish all life as quickly as possible.   In order to
  learn the forward model of the game, we formulate the problem in a novel way that
  learns the local cell transition function by creating a set of supervised training
  data and predicting the next state of each cell in the grid based on its current
  state and immediate neighbours. Using this method we are able to harvest sufficient
  data to learn perfect forward models by observing only a few complete state transitions,
  using either a look-up table, a decision tree or a neural network.   In contrast,
  learning the complete state transition function is a much harder task and our initial
  efforts to do this using deep convolutional auto-encoders were less successful.   We
  also investigate the effects of imperfect learned models on prediction errors and
  game-playing performance, and show that even models with significant errors can
  provide good performance.
