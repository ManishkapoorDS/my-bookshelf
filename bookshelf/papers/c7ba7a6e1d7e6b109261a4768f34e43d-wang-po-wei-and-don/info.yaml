abstract: Integrating logical reasoning within deep learning architectures has been
  a major goal of modern AI systems. In this paper, we propose a new direction toward
  this goal by introducing a differentiable (smoothed) maximum satisfiability (MAXSAT)
  solver that can be integrated into the loop of larger deep learning systems. Our
  (approximate) solver is based upon a fast coordinate descent approach to solving
  the semidefinite program (SDP) associated with the MAXSAT problem. We show how to
  analytically differentiate through the solution to this SDP and efficiently solve
  the associated backward pass. We demonstrate that by integrating this solver into
  end-to-end learning systems, we can learn the logical structure of challenging problems
  in a minimally supervised fashion. In particular, we show that we can learn the
  parity function using single-bit supervision (a traditionally hard task for deep
  networks) and learn how to play 9x9 Sudoku solely from examples. We also solve a
  "visual Sudok" problem that maps images of Sudoku puzzles to their associated logical
  solutions by combining our MAXSAT solver with a traditional convolutional architecture.
  Our approach thus shows promise in integrating logical structures within deep learning.
