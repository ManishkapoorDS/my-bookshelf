abstract: We identify a new representation of propositional knowledge bases, the Sentential
  Decision Diagram (SDD), which is interesting for a number of reasons. First, it
  is canonical in the presence of additional properties that resemble reduction rules
  of OBDDs. Second, SDDs can be combined using any Boolean operator in polytime. Third,
  CNFs with n variables and treewidth w have canonical SDDs of size O(n2w), which
  is tighter than the bound on OBDDs based on pathwidth. Finally, every OBDD is an
  SDD. Hence, working with the latter does not preclude the former.
