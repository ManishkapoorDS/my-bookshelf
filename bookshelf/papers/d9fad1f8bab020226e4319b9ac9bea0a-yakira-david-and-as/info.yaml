abstract: We study the problem of providing blockchain applications with \emph{economically
  viable randomness} (EVR), namely, randomness that has significant economic consequences.
  Applications of EVR include blockchain-based lotteries and gambling. An EVR source
  guarantees (i) secrecy, assuring that the random bits are kept secret until some
  predefined condition indicates that they are safe to reveal (e.g., the lottery's
  ticket sale closes), and (ii) robustness, guaranteeing that the random bits are
  published once the condition holds. We formalize the EVR problem and solve it on
  top of an Ethereum-like blockchain abstraction, which supports smart contracts and
  a transferable native coin. Randomness is generated via a distributed open commit-reveal
  scheme by game-theoretic agents who strive to maximize their coin holdings. Note
  that in an economic setting, such agents might profit from breaking secrecy or robustness,
  and may engage in side agreements (via smart contracts) to this end. Our solution
  creates an incentive structure that counters such attacks. We prove that following
  the protocol gives rise to a stable state, called Coalition-Proof Nash Equilibrium,
  from which no coalition comprised of a subset of the players can agree to deviate.
  In this stable state, robustness and secrecy are satisfied. Finally, we implement
  our EVR source over Ethereum.
