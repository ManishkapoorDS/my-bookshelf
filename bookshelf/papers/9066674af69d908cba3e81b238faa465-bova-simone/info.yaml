abstract: Introduced by Darwiche (2011), sentential decision diagrams (SDDs) are essentially
  as tractable as ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs), but tend to be more succinct
  in practice. This makes SDDs a prominent representation language, with many applications
  in artificial intelligence and knowledge compilation. We prove that SDDs are more
  succinct than OBDDs also in theory, by constructing a family of boolean functions
  where each member has polynomial SDD size but exponential OBDD size. This exponential
  separation improves a quasipolynomial separation recently established by Razgon
  (2013), and settles an open problem in knowledge compilation.
