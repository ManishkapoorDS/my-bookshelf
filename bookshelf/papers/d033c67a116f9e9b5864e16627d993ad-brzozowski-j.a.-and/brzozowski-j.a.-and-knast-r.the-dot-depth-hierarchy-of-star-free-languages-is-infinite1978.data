               Abstract
               
                  Let A be a finite alphabet and A∗
                      the free monoid generated by A. A language is any subset of A∗
                     . Assume that all the languages of the form {a}, where a is either the empty word or a letter in A, are given. Close this basic family of languages under Boolean operations; let 
                        B
                     
                     (0) be the resulting Boolean algebra of languages. Next, close 
                        B
                     
                     (0) under concatenation and then close the resulting family under Boolean operations. Call this new Boolean algebra 
                        B
                     
                     (1), etc. The sequence 
                        B
                     
                     (0), 
                        B
                     
                     (1),…, 
                        B
                     
                     
                        k
                     ,… of Boolean algebras is called the dot-depth hierarchy. The union of all these Boolean algebras is the family 
                        A
                      of star-free or aperiodic languages which is the same as the family of noncounting regular languages. Over an alphabet of one letter the hierarchy is finite; in fact, 
                        B
                     
                     (2) = 
                        B
                     
                     (1). We show in this paper that the hierarchy is infinite for any alphabet with two or more letters.
