abstract: 'Recently, it was shown that any theory of strings containing the string-replace
  function (even the most restricted version where pattern/replacement strings are
  both constant strings) becomes undecidable if we do not impose some kind of straight-line
  (aka acyclicity) restriction on the formulas. Despite this, the straight-line restriction
  is still practically sensible since this condition is typically met by string constraints
  that are generated by symbolic execution. In this paper, we provide the first systematic
  study of straight-line string constraints with the string-replace function and the
  regular constraints as the basic operations. We show that a large class of such
  constraints (i.e. when only a constant string or a regular expression is permitted
  in the pattern) is decidable. We note that the string-replace function, even under
  this restriction, is sufficiently powerful for expressing the concatenation operator
  and much more (e.g. extensions of regular expressions with string variables). This
  gives us the most expressive decidable logic containing concatenation, replace,
  and regular constraints under the same umbrella. Our decision procedure for the
  straight-line fragment follows an automata-theoretic approach, and is modular in
  the sense that the string-replace terms are removed one by one to generate more
  and more regular constraints, which can then be discharged by the state-of-the-art
  string constraint solvers. We also show that this fragment is, in a way, a maximal
  decidable subclass of the straight-line fragment with string-replace and regular
  constraints. To this end, we show undecidability results for the following two extensions:
  (1) variables are permitted in the pattern parameter of the replace function, (2)
  length constraints are permitted.'
