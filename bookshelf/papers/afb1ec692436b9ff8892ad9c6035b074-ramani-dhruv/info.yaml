abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning which is employed
  to solve various sequential decision making problems without proper supervision.
  Due to the recent advancement of deep learning, the newly proposed Deep-RL algorithms
  have been able to perform extremely well in sophisticated high-dimensional environments.
  However, even after successes in many domains, one of the major challenge in these
  approaches is the high magnitude of interactions with the environment required for
  efficient decision making. Seeking inspiration from the brain, this problem can
  be solved by incorporating instance based learning by biasing the decision making
  on the memories of high rewarding experiences. This paper reviews various recent
  reinforcement learning methods which incorporate external memory to solve decision
  making and a survey of them is presented. We provide an overview of the different
  methods - along with their advantages and disadvantages, applications and the standard
  experimentation settings used for memory based models. This review hopes to be a
  helpful resource to provide key insight of the recent advances in the field and
  provide help in further future development of it.
