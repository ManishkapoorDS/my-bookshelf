abstract: Feature representations, both hand-designed and learned ones, are often
  hard to analyze and interpret, even when they are extracted from visual data. We
  propose a new approach to study image representations by inverting them with an
  up-convolutional neural network. We apply the method to shallow representations
  (HOG, SIFT, LBP), as well as to deep networks. For shallow representations our approach
  provides significantly better reconstructions than existing methods, revealing that
  there is surprisingly rich information contained in these features. Inverting a
  deep network trained on ImageNet provides several insights into the properties of
  the feature representation learned by the network. Most strikingly, the colors and
  the rough contours of an image can be reconstructed from activations in higher network
  layers and even from the predicted class probabilities.
