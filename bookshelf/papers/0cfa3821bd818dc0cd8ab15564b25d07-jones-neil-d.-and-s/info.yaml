abstract: <jats:p>H. Scholz [11] defined the <jats:italic>spectrum</jats:italic> of
  a formula φ of first-order logic with equality to be the set of all natural numbers
  <jats:italic>n</jats:italic> for which φ has a model of cardinality <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>.
  He then asked for a characterization of spectra. Only partial progress has been
  made. Computational aspects of this problem have been worked on by Gunter Asser
  [1], A. Mostowski [9], and J. H. Bennett [2]. It is known that spectra include the
  Grzegorczyk class <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
  mime-subtype="gif" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="S0022481200065531_inline1" />
  and are properly included in <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
  mime-subtype="gif" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="S0022481200065531_inline2" />.
  However, no progress has been made toward establishing whether spectra properly
  include <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" mime-subtype="gif"
  xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="S0022481200065531_inline1" />, or whether spectra
  are closed under complementation.</jats:p><jats:p>A possible connection with automata
  theory arises from the fact that <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
  mime-subtype="gif" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="S0022481200065531_inline1" />
  contains just those sets which are accepted by deterministic linear-bounded Turing
  machines (Ritchie [10]). Another resemblance lies in the fact that the same two
  problems (closure under complement, and proper inclusion of <jats:inline-graphic
  xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" mime-subtype="gif" xlink:type="simple"
  xlink:href="S0022481200065531_inline1" />) have remained open for the class of context
  sensitive languages for several years.</jats:p><jats:p>In this paper we show that
  these similarities are not accidental—that spectra and context sensitive languages
  are closely related, and that their open questions are merely special cases of a
  family of open questions which relate to the difference (if any) between deterministic
  and nondeterministic time or space bounded Turing machines.</jats:p><jats:p>In particular
  we show that spectra are just those sets which are acceptable by nondeterministic
  Turing machines in time 2<jats:sup><jats:italic>cx</jats:italic></jats:sup>, where
  <jats:italic>c</jats:italic> is constant and <jats:italic>x</jats:italic> is the
  length of the input. Combining this result with results of Bennett [2], Ritchie
  [10], Kuroda [7], and Cook [3], we obtain the “hierarchy” of classes of sets shown
  in Figure 1. It is of interest to note that in all of these cases the amount of
  unrestricted read/write memory appears to be too small to allow diagonalization
  within the larger classes.</jats:p>
