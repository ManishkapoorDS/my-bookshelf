abstract: Pylearn2 is a machine learning research library. This does not just mean
  that it is a collection of machine learning algorithms that share a common API;
  it means that it has been designed for flexibility and extensibility in order to
  facilitate research projects that involve new or unusual use cases. In this paper
  we give a brief history of the library, an overview of its basic philosophy, a summary
  of the library's architecture, and a description of how the Pylearn2 community functions
  socially.
