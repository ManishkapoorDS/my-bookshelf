abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has made great achievements since proposed.
  Generally, DRL agents receive high-dimensional inputs at each step, and make actions
  according to deep-neural-network-based policies. This learning mechanism updates
  the policy to maximize the return with an end-to-end method. In this paper, we survey
  the progress of DRL methods, including value-based, policy gradient, and model-based
  algorithms, and compare their main techniques and properties. Besides, DRL plays
  an important role in game artificial intelligence (AI). We also take a review of
  the achievements of DRL in various video games, including classical Arcade games,
  first-person perspective games and multi-agent real-time strategy games, from 2D
  to 3D, and from single-agent to multi-agent. A large number of video game AIs with
  DRL have achieved super-human performance, while there are still some challenges
  in this domain. Therefore, we also discuss some key points when applying DRL methods
  to this field, including exploration-exploitation, sample efficiency, generalization
  and transfer, multi-agent learning, imperfect information, and delayed spare rewards,
  as well as some research directions.
