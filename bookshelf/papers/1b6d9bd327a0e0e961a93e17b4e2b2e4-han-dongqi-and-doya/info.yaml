abstract: 'In partially observable (PO) environments, deep reinforcement learning
  (RL) agents often suffer from unsatisfactory performance, since two problems need
  to be tackled together: how to extract information from the raw observations to
  solve the task, and how to improve the policy. In this study, we propose an RL algorithm
  for solving PO tasks. Our method comprises two parts: a variational recurrent model
  (VRM) for modeling the environment, and an RL controller that has access to both
  the environment and the VRM. The proposed algorithm was tested in two types of PO
  robotic control tasks, those in which either coordinates or velocities were not
  observable and those that require long-term memorization. Our experiments show that
  the proposed algorithm achieved better data efficiency and/or learned more optimal
  policy than other alternative approaches in tasks in which unobserved states cannot
  be inferred from raw observations in a simple manner.'
