abstract: We consider the problem of bottom-up compilation of knowledge bases, which
  is usually predicated on the existence of a polytime function for combining compilations
  using Boolean operators (usually called an Apply function). While such a polytime
  Apply function is known to exist for certain languages (e.g., OBDDs) and not exist
  for others (e.g., DNNF), its existence for certain languages remains unknown. Among
  the latter is the recently introduced language of Sentential Decision Diagrams (SDDs),
  for which a polytime Apply function exists for unreduced SDDs, but remains unknown
  for reduced ones (i.e. canonical SDDs). We resolve this open question in this paper
  and consider some of its theoretical and practical implications. Some of the findings
  we report question the common wisdom on the relationship between bottom-up compilation,
  language canonicity and the complexity of the Apply function.
