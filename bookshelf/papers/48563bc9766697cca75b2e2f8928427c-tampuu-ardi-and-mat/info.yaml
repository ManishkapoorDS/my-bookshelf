abstract: Multiagent systems appear in most social, economical, and political situations.
  In the present work we extend the Deep Q-Learning Network architecture proposed
  by Google DeepMind to multiagent environments and investigate how two agents controlled
  by independent Deep Q-Networks interact in the classic videogame Pong. By manipulating
  the classical rewarding scheme of Pong we demonstrate how competitive and collaborative
  behaviors emerge. Competitive agents learn to play and score efficiently. Agents
  trained under collaborative rewarding schemes find an optimal strategy to keep the
  ball in the game as long as possible. We also describe the progression from competitive
  to collaborative behavior. The present work demonstrates that Deep Q-Networks can
  become a practical tool for studying the decentralized learning of multiagent systems
  living in highly complex environments.
