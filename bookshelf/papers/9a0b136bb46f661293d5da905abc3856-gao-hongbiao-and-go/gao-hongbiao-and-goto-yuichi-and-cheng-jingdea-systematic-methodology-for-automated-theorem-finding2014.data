               Abstract
               
                  The problem of automated theorem finding is one of the 33 basic research problems in automated reasoning which was originally proposed by Wos in 1988, and it is still an open problem. To solve the problem, an approach of forward deduction based on the strong relevant logics was proposed. Following the approach, this paper presents a systematic methodology for automated theorem finding. To show the effectiveness of our methodology, the paper presents two case studies, one is automated theorem finding in NBG set theory and the other is automated theorem finding in Peano's arithmetic. Some known theorems have been found in our case studies.
