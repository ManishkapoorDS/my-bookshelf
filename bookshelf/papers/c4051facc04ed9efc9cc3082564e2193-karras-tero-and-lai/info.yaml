abstract: We propose an alternative generator architecture for generative adversarial
  networks, borrowing from style transfer literature. The new architecture leads to
  an automatically learned, unsupervised separation of high-level attributes (e.g.,
  pose and identity when trained on human faces) and stochastic variation in the generated
  images (e.g., freckles, hair), and it enables intuitive, scale-specific control
  of the synthesis. The new generator improves the state-of-the-art in terms of traditional
  distribution quality metrics, leads to demonstrably better interpolation properties,
  and also better disentangles the latent factors of variation. To quantify interpolation
  quality and disentanglement, we propose two new, automated methods that are applicable
  to any generator architecture. Finally, we introduce a new, highly varied and high-quality
  dataset of human faces.
