abstract: 'Concentration inequalities are fundamental tools in probabilistic combinatorics
  and theoretical computer science for proving that random functions are near their
  means. Of particular importance is the case where f(X) is a function of independent
  random variables X=(X_1, ..., X_n). Here the well known bounded differences inequality
  (also called McDiarmid''s or Hoeffding-Azuma inequality) establishes sharp concentration
  if the function f does not depend too much on any of the variables. One attractive
  feature is that it relies on a very simple Lipschitz condition (L): it suffices
  to show that |f(X)-f(X'')| \leq c_k whenever X,X'' differ only in X_k. While this
  is easy to check, the main disadvantage is that it considers worst-case changes
  c_k, which often makes the resulting bounds too weak to be useful.   In this paper
  we prove a variant of the bounded differences inequality which can be used to establish
  concentration of functions f(X) where (i) the typical changes are small although
  (ii) the worst case changes might be very large. One key aspect of this inequality
  is that it relies on a simple condition that (a) is easy to check and (b) coincides
  with heuristic considerations why concentration should hold. Indeed, given an event
  \Gamma that holds with very high probability, we essentially relax the Lipschitz
  condition (L) to situations where \Gamma occurs. The point is that the resulting
  typical changes c_k are often much smaller than the worst case ones.   To illustrate
  its application we consider the reverse H-free process, where H is 2-balanced. We
  prove that the final number of edges in this process is concentrated, and also determine
  its likely value up to constant factors. This answers a question of Bollob\''as
  and Erd\H{o}s.'
