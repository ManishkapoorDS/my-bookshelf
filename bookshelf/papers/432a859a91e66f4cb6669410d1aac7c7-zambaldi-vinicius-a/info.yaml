abstract: We introduce an approach for deep reinforcement learning (RL) that improves
  upon the efficiency, generalization capacity, and interpretability of conventional
  approaches through structured perception and relational reasoning. It uses self-attention
  to iteratively reason about the relations between entities in a scene and to guide
  a model-free policy. Our results show that in a novel navigation and planning task
  called Box-World, our agent finds interpretable solutions that improve upon baselines
  in terms of sample complexity, ability to generalize to more complex scenes than
  experienced during training, and overall performance. In the StarCraft II Learning
  Environment, our agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on six mini-games --
  surpassing human grandmaster performance on four. By considering architectural inductive
  biases, our work opens new directions for overcoming important, but stubborn, challenges
  in deep RL.
