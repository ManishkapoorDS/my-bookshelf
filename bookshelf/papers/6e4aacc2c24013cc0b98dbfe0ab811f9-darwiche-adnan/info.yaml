abstract: We propose a method for compiling propositional theories into a new tractable
  form that we refer to as decomposable negation normal form (DNNF). We show a number
  of results about our compilation approach. First, we show that every propositional
  theory can be compiled into DNNF and present an algorithm to this effect. Second,
  we show that if a clausal form has a bounded treewidth, then its DNNF compilation
  has a linear size and can be computed in linear time - treewidth is a graphtheoretic
  parameter which measures the connectivity of the clausal form. Third, we show that
  once a propositional theory is compiled into DNNF, a number of reasoning tasks,
  such as satisfiability and forgetting, can be performed in linear time. Finally,
  we propose two techniques for approximating the DNNF compilation of a theory when
  the size of such compilation is too large to be practical. One of the techniques
  generates a sound but incomplete compilation, while the other generates a complete
  but unsound compilation. Together, these approximations bound the exact compilation
  from below and above in terms for their ability to answer queries.
