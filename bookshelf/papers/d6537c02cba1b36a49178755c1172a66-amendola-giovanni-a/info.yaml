abstract: We propose two models of random quantified boolean formulas and their natural
  random disjunctive logic program counterparts. The models extend the standard models
  of random k-CNF formulas and the Chen-Interian model of random 2QBFs. The first
  model controls the generation of programs and QSAT formulas by imposing a specific
  structure on rules and clauses, respectively. The second model is based on a family
  of QSAT formulas in a non-clausal form. We provide theoretical bounds for the phase
  transition region in our models, and show experimentally the presence of the easy-hard-easy
  pattern and its alignment with the location of the phase transition. We show that
  boolean formulas and logic programs from our models are significantly harder than
  those obtained from the standard k-CNF and Chen-Interian models, and that their
  combination yields formulas and programs that are "super-hard" to evaluate. We also
  provide evidence suggesting that formulas from one of our models are well suited
  for assessing solvers tuned to real-world instances. Finally, it is noteworthy that,
  to the best of our knowledge, our models and results on random disjunctive logic
  programs are the first of their kind.
