abstract: Traditional methods of computer vision and machine learning cannot match
  human performance on tasks such as the recognition of handwritten digits or traffic
  signs. Our biologically plausible deep artificial neural network architectures can.
  Small (often minimal) receptive fields of convolutional winner-take-all neurons
  yield large network depth, resulting in roughly as many sparsely connected neural
  layers as found in mammals between retina and visual cortex. Only winner neurons
  are trained. Several deep neural columns become experts on inputs preprocessed in
  different ways; their predictions are averaged. Graphics cards allow for fast training.
  On the very competitive MNIST handwriting benchmark, our method is the first to
  achieve near-human performance. On a traffic sign recognition benchmark it outperforms
  humans by a factor of two. We also improve the state-of-the-art on a plethora of
  common image classification benchmarks.
