abstract: A first line of attack in exploratory data analysis is data visualization,
  i.e., generating a 2-dimensional representation of data that makes clusters of similar
  points visually identifiable. Standard Johnson-Lindenstrauss dimensionality reduction
  does not produce data visualizations. The t-SNE heuristic of van der Maaten and
  Hinton, which is based on non-convex optimization, has become the de facto standard
  for visualization in a wide range of applications.   This work gives a formal framework
  for the problem of data visualization - finding a 2-dimensional embedding of clusterable
  data that correctly separates individual clusters to make them visually identifiable.
  We then give a rigorous analysis of the performance of t-SNE under a natural, deterministic
  condition on the "ground-truth" clusters (similar to conditions assumed in earlier
  analyses of clustering) in the underlying data. These are the first provable guarantees
  on t-SNE for constructing good data visualizations.   We show that our deterministic
  condition is satisfied by considerably general probabilistic generative models for
  clusterable data such as mixtures of well-separated log-concave distributions. Finally,
  we give theoretical evidence that t-SNE provably succeeds in partially recovering
  cluster structure even when the above deterministic condition is not met.
