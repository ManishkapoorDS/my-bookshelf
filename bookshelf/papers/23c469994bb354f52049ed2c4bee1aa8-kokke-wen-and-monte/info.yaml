abstract: 'Process calculi based on logic, such as $\pi$DILL and CP, provide a foundation
  for deadlock-free concurrent programming. However, in previous work, there is a
  mismatch between the rules for constructing proofs and the term constructors of
  the $\pi$-calculus: the fundamental operator for parallel composition does not correspond
  to any rule of linear logic. Kokke et al. (2019) introduced Hypersequent Classical
  Processes (HCP), which addresses this mismatch using hypersequents (collections
  of sequents) to register parallelism in the typing judgements. However, the step
  from CP to HCP is a big one. As of yet, HCP does not have reduction semantics, and
  the addition of delayed actions means that CP processes interpreted as HCP processes
  do not behave as they would in CP. We introduce HCP-, a variant of HCP with reduction
  semantics and without delayed actions. We prove progress, preservation, and termination,
  and show that HCP- supports the same communication protocols as CP.'
