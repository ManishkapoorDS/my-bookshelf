abstract: Every year, novel NVIDIA GPU designs are introduced. This rapid architectural
  and technological progression, coupled with a reluctance by manufacturers to disclose
  low-level details, makes it difficult for even the most proficient GPU software
  designers to remain up-to-date with the technological advances at a microarchitectural
  level. To address this dearth of public, microarchitectural-level information on
  the novel NVIDIA GPUs, independent researchers have resorted to microbenchmarks-based
  dissection and discovery. This has led to a prolific line of publications that shed
  light on instruction encoding, and memory hierarchy's geometry and features at each
  level. Namely, research that describes the performance and behavior of the Kepler,
  Maxwell and Pascal architectures. In this technical report, we continue this line
  of research by presenting the microarchitectural details of the NVIDIA Volta architecture,
  discovered through microbenchmarks and instruction set disassembly. Additionally,
  we compare quantitatively our Volta findings against its predecessors, Kepler, Maxwell
  and Pascal.
