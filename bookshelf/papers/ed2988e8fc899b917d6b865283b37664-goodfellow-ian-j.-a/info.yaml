abstract: Recognizing arbitrary multi-character text in unconstrained natural photographs
  is a hard problem. In this paper, we address an equally hard sub-problem in this
  domain viz. recognizing arbitrary multi-digit numbers from Street View imagery.
  Traditional approaches to solve this problem typically separate out the localization,
  segmentation, and recognition steps. In this paper we propose a unified approach
  that integrates these three steps via the use of a deep convolutional neural network
  that operates directly on the image pixels. We employ the DistBelief implementation
  of deep neural networks in order to train large, distributed neural networks on
  high quality images. We find that the performance of this approach increases with
  the depth of the convolutional network, with the best performance occurring in the
  deepest architecture we trained, with eleven hidden layers. We evaluate this approach
  on the publicly available SVHN dataset and achieve over $96\%$ accuracy in recognizing
  complete street numbers. We show that on a per-digit recognition task, we improve
  upon the state-of-the-art, achieving $97.84\%$ accuracy. We also evaluate this approach
  on an even more challenging dataset generated from Street View imagery containing
  several tens of millions of street number annotations and achieve over $90\%$ accuracy.
  To further explore the applicability of the proposed system to broader text recognition
  tasks, we apply it to synthetic distorted text from reCAPTCHA. reCAPTCHA is one
  of the most secure reverse turing tests that uses distorted text to distinguish
  humans from bots. We report a $99.8\%$ accuracy on the hardest category of reCAPTCHA.
  Our evaluations on both tasks indicate that at specific operating thresholds, the
  performance of the proposed system is comparable to, and in some cases exceeds,
  that of human operators.
