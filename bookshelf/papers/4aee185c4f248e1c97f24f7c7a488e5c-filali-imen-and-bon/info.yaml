abstract: The Semantic Web enables the possibility to model, create and query resources
  found on the Web. Enabling the full potential of its technologies at the Internet
  level requires infrastructures that can cope with scalability challenges while supporting
  expressive queries. The attractive features of the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) communication
  model, and more specifically structured P2P systems, such as decentralization, scalability,
  fault-tolerance seems to be a natural solution to deal with these challenges. Consequently,
  the combination of the Semantic Web and the P2P model can be a highly innovative
  attempt to harness the strengths of both technologies and come up with a scalable
  infrastructure for RDF data storage and retrieval. In this respect, this survey
  details the research works adopting this combination and gives an insight on how
  to deal with the RDF data at the indexing and querying levels. We also present some
  works which adopt the publish/subscribe paradigm for processing RDF data in order
  to offer long standing queries.
