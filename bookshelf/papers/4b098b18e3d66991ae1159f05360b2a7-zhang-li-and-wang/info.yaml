abstract: Researchers on artificial intelligence have achieved human-level intelligence
  in large-scale perfect-information games, but it is still a challenge to achieve
  (nearly) optimal results (in other words, an approximate Nash Equilibrium) in large-scale
  imperfect-information games (i.e. war games, football coach or business strategies).
  Neural Fictitious Self Play (NFSP) is an effective algorithm for learning approximate
  Nash equilibrium of imperfect-information games from self-play without prior domain
  knowledge. However, it relies on Deep Q-Network, which is off-line and is hard to
  converge in online games with changing opponent strategy, so it can't approach approximate
  Nash equilibrium in games with large search scale and deep search depth. In this
  paper, we propose Monte Carlo Neural Fictitious Self Play (MC-NFSP), an algorithm
  combines Monte Carlo tree search with NFSP, which greatly improves the performance
  on large-scale zero-sum imperfect-information games. Experimentally, we demonstrate
  that the proposed Monte Carlo Neural Fictitious Self Play can converge to approximate
  Nash equilibrium in games with large-scale search depth while the Neural Fictitious
  Self Play can't. Furthermore, we develop Asynchronous Neural Fictitious Self Play
  (ANFSP). It use asynchronous and parallel architecture to collect game experience.
  In experiments, we show that parallel actor-learners have a further accelerated
  and stabilizing effect on training.
