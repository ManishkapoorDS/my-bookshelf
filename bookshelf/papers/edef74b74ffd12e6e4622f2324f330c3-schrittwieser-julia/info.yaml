abstract: 'Constructing agents with planning capabilities has long been one of the
  main challenges in the pursuit of artificial intelligence. Tree-based planning methods
  have enjoyed huge success in challenging domains, such as chess and Go, where a
  perfect simulator is available. However, in real-world problems the dynamics governing
  the environment are often complex and unknown. In this work we present the MuZero
  algorithm which, by combining a tree-based search with a learned model, achieves
  superhuman performance in a range of challenging and visually complex domains, without
  any knowledge of their underlying dynamics. MuZero learns a model that, when applied
  iteratively, predicts the quantities most directly relevant to planning: the reward,
  the action-selection policy, and the value function. When evaluated on 57 different
  Atari games - the canonical video game environment for testing AI techniques, in
  which model-based planning approaches have historically struggled - our new algorithm
  achieved a new state of the art. When evaluated on Go, chess and shogi, without
  any knowledge of the game rules, MuZero matched the superhuman performance of the
  AlphaZero algorithm that was supplied with the game rules.'
