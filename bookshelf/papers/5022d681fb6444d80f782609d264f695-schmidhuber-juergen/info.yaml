abstract: I argue that data becomes temporarily interesting by itself to some self-improving,
  but computationally limited, subjective observer once he learns to predict or compress
  the data in a better way, thus making it subjectively simpler and more beautiful.
  Curiosity is the desire to create or discover more non-random, non-arbitrary, regular
  data that is novel and surprising not in the traditional sense of Boltzmann and
  Shannon but in the sense that it allows for compression progress because its regularity
  was not yet known. This drive maximizes interestingness, the first derivative of
  subjective beauty or compressibility, that is, the steepness of the learning curve.
  It motivates exploring infants, pure mathematicians, composers, artists, dancers,
  comedians, yourself, and (since 1990) artificial systems.
