abstract: One of the modern paradigms to develop a system is object oriented analysis
  and design. In this paradigm, there are several objects and each object plays some
  specific roles. After identifying objects, the various relationships among objects
  must be identified. This paper makes a literature review over relationships among
  objects. Mainly, the relationships are three basic types, including generalization/specialization,
  aggregation and association.This paper presents five taxonomies for properties of
  the relationships. The first taxonomy is based on temporal view. The second taxonomy
  is based on structure and the third one relies on behavioral. The fourth taxonomy
  is specified on mathematical view and fifth one related to the interface. Additionally,
  the properties of the relationships are evaluated in a case study and several recommendations
  are proposed.
