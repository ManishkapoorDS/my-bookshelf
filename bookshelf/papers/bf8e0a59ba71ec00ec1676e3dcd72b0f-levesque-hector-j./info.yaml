title: Making Believers out of Computers**This is a slightly revised transcription
  of a lecture presented upon receipt of the 1985 Computers and Thought Award of the
  International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence. The lecture was intended
  to be a retrospective on my own work for a fairly broad audience. I took a stab
  at clarifying the original where I could, but I would have had to overhaul it completely
  to make it scholarly or technically precise.
