abstract: OpenAI Gym is a toolkit for reinforcement learning research. It includes
  a growing collection of benchmark problems that expose a common interface, and a
  website where people can share their results and compare the performance of algorithms.
  This whitepaper discusses the components of OpenAI Gym and the design decisions
  that went into the software.
