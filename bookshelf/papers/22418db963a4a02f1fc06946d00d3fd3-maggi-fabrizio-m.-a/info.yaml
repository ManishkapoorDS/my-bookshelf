abstract: Temporal logics over finite traces have recently seen wide application in
  a number of areas, from business process modelling, monitoring, and mining to planning
  and decision making. However, real-life dynamic systems contain a degree of uncertainty
  which cannot be handled with classical logics. We thus propose a new probabilistic
  temporal logic over finite traces using superposition semantics, where all possible
  evolutions are possible, until observed. We study the properties of the logic and
  provide automata-based mechanisms for deriving probabilistic inferences from its
  formulas. We then study a fragment of the logic with better computational properties.
  Notably, formulas in this fragment can be discovered from event log data using off-the-shelf
  existing declarative process discovery techniques.
