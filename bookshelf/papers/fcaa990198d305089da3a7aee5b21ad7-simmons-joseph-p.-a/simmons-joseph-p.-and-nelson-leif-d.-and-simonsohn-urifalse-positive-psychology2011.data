First, we show that despite empirical psychologists’ nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>methodology</kwd><x>, </x><kwd>motivated reasoning</kwd><x>, </x><kwd>publication</kwd><x>, </x><kwd>disclosure</kwd></kwd-group><self-uri xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797611417632"/>
</article-meta></front><body><p>Our job as scientists is to discover truths about the world. We generate hypotheses, collect data, and examine whether or not the data are consistent with those hypotheses. Although we aspire to always be accurate, errors are inevitable.</p><p>Perhaps the most costly error is a <italic>false positive</italic>, the incorrect rejection of a null hypothesis. First, once they appear in the literature, false positives are particularly persistent. Because null results have many possible causes, failures to replicate previous findings are never conclusive. Furthermore, because it is uncommon for prestigious journals to publish null findings or exact replications, researchers have little incentive to even attempt them. Second, false positives waste resources: They inspire investment in fruitless research programs and can lead to ineffective policy changes. Finally, a field known for publishing false positives risks losing its credibility.</p><p>In this article, we show that despite the nominal endorsement of a maximum false-positive rate of 5% (i.e., <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05), current standards for disclosing details of data collection and analyses make false positives vastly more likely. In fact, it is unacceptably easy to publish “statistically significant” evidence consistent with <italic>any</italic> hypothesis.</p><p>The culprit is a construct we refer to as <italic>researcher degrees of freedom</italic>. In the course of collecting and analyzing data, researchers have many decisions to make: Should more data be collected? Should some observations be excluded? Which conditions should be combined and which ones compared? Which control variables should be considered? Should specific measures be combined or transformed or both?</p><p>It is rare, and sometimes impractical, for researchers to make all these decisions beforehand. Rather, it is common (and accepted practice) for researchers to explore various analytic alternatives, to search for a combination that yields “statistical significance,” and to then report only what “worked.” The problem, of course, is that the likelihood of at least one (of many) analyses producing a falsely positive finding at the 5% level is necessarily greater than 5%.</p><p>This exploratory behavior is not the by-product of malicious intent, but rather the result of two factors: (a) ambiguity in how best to make these decisions and (b) the researcher’s desire to find a statistically significant result. A large literature documents that people are self-serving in their interpretation of ambiguous information and remarkably adept at reaching justifiable conclusions that mesh with their desires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797611417632">Babcock &amp; Loewenstein, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797611417632">Dawson, Gilovich, &amp; Regan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797611417632">Gilovich, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797611417632">Hastorf &amp; Cantril, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797611417632">Kunda, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797611417632">Zuckerman, 1979</xref>). This literature suggests that when we as researchers face ambiguous analytic decisions, we will tend to conclude, with convincing self-justification, that the appropriate decisions are those that result in statistical significance (<italic>p</italic> ≤ .05).</p><p>Ambiguity is rampant in empirical research. As an example, consider a very simple decision faced by researchers analyzing reaction times: how to treat outliers. In a perusal of roughly 30 <italic>Psychological Science</italic> articles, we discovered considerable inconsistency in, and hence considerable ambiguity about, this decision. Most (but not all) researchers excluded some responses for being too fast, but what constituted “too fast” varied enormously: the fastest 2.5%, or faster than 2 standard deviations from the mean, or faster than 100 or 150 or 200 or 300 ms. Similarly, what constituted “too slow” varied enormously: the slowest 2.5% or 10%, or 2 or 2.5 or 3 standard deviations slower than the mean, or 1.5 standard deviations slower from that condition’s mean, or slower than 1,000 or 1,200 or 1,500 or 2,000 or 3,000 or 5,000 ms. None of these decisions is necessarily incorrect, but that fact makes any of them justifiable and hence potential fodder for self-serving justifications.</p><sec id="section1-0956797611417632"><title>How Bad Can It Be?

We also investigated various combinations of these degrees of freedom.</p><p>We generated random samples with each observation independently drawn from a normal distribution, performed sets of analyses on each sample, and observed how often at least one of the resulting <italic>p</italic> values in each sample was below standard significance levels. For example, imagine a researcher who collects two dependent variables, say liking and willingness to pay. The researcher can test whether the manipulation affected liking, whether the manipulation affected willingness to pay, and whether the manipulation affected a combination of these two variables. The likelihood that one of these tests produces a significant result is at least somewhat higher than .05.

We did not consider many other degrees of freedom that researchers commonly use, including testing and choosing among more than two dependent variables (and the various ways to combine them), testing and choosing among more than one covariate (and the various ways to combine them), excluding subsets of participants or trials, flexibility in deciding whether early data were part of a pilot study or part of the experiment proper, and so on.</p></sec><sec id="section7-0956797611417632"><title>A closer look at flexibility in sample size</title><p>Researchers often decide when to stop data collection on the basis of interim data analysis.

For example, reviewer reports might include questions such as, “Do the results also hold if the baseline measure is instead used as a covariate?” Similarly, reviewers should ensure that arbitrary decisions are used consistently across studies (e.g., “Do the results hold for Study 3 if gender is entered as a covariate, as was done in Study 2?”).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0956797611417632">5</xref></sup> If a result holds only for one arbitrary specification, then everyone involved has learned a great deal about the robustness (or lack thereof) of the effect.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>If justifications of data collection or analysis are not compelling, reviewers should require the authors to conduct an exact replication.</bold> If a reviewer is not persuaded by the justifications for a given researcher degree of freedom or the results from a robustness check, the reviewer should ask the author to conduct an exact replication of the study and its analysis.

A reviewer would hence have been unable to assess the flexibility involved in selecting father’s age as a control. Second, by reporting only results that included the covariate, we made it impossible for readers to discover its critical role in achieving a significant result. Seeing the full list of variables now disclosed, reviewers would have an easy time asking for robustness checks, such as “Are the results from Study 1 replicated in Study 2?” They are not: People felt older rather than younger after listening to “When I’m Sixty-Four,” though not significantly so, <italic>F</italic>(1, 17) = 2.07, <italic>p</italic> = .168.

Most notably, it cannot reveal those arising from reporting only experiments that “work” (i.e., the file-drawer problem). This problem might be addressed by requiring researchers to submit all studies to a public repository, whether or not the studies are “successful” (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797611417632">Ioannidis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797611417632">Schooler, 2011</xref>). Although we are sympathetic to this suggestion, it does come with significant practical challenges: How is submission enforced? How does one ensure that study descriptions are understandably written and appropriately classified? Most notably, in order for the repository to be effective, it must adhere to our disclosure policy, for it is impossible to interpret study results, whether successful or not, unless researcher degrees of freedom are disclosed. The repository is an ambitious long-term extension of our recommended solution, not a substitute.</p><p>In addition, a reviewer of this article worried that our solution may not go far enough because authors have “tremendous disincentives” to disclose exploited researcher degrees of freedom. Although researchers obviously have incentives to publish, if editors and reviewers enforce our solution, authors will have even stronger incentives to accurately disclose their methodology. Our solution turns inconsequential sins of omission (leaving out inconvenient facts) into consequential, potentially career-ending sins of commission (writing demonstrably false statements). Journals implementing our disclosure requirements will create a virtuous cycle of transparency and accountability that eliminates the disincentive problem.</p></sec><sec id="section15-0956797611417632"><title>Too far</title><p>Alternatively, some readers may be concerned that our guidelines prevent researchers from conducting exploratory research. What if researchers do not know which dependent measures will be sensitive to the manipulation, for example, or how such dependent measures should be scored or combined? We all should of course engage in exploratory research, but we should be required either to report it as such (i.e., following the six requirements) or to complement it with (and possibly only report) confirmatory research consisting of exact replications of the design and analysis that “worked” in the exploratory phase.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section16-0956797611417632"><title>Nonsolutions</title><p>In the process of devising our solution, we considered a number of alternative ways to address the problem of researcher degrees of freedom. We believe that all solutions other than the one we have outlined are less practical, less effective, or both. It might be worth pursuing these other policy changes for other reasons, but in our view, they do not address the problem of researcher degrees of freedom. The following are four policy changes we considered and rejected.</p><sec id="section17-0956797611417632"><title>Correcting alpha levels</title><p>Á la Bonferroni, one may consider adjusting the critical alpha (α) level as a function of the number of researcher degrees of freedom employed in each study, as is supposed to be done with multiple-hypothesis testing. Something like this has been proposed for medical trials that monitor outcomes as the study progresses (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797611417632">Pocock, 1977</xref>).</p><p>First, given the broad and ambiguous set of degrees of freedom in question, it is unclear which and how many of them contribute to any given finding, and hence what their effect is on the false-positive rate. Second, unless there is an explicit rule about exactly how to adjust alphas for each degree of freedom and for the various combinations of degrees of freedom (see the bottom three rows in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0956797611417632">Table 1</xref>), the additional ambiguity may make things worse by introducing new degrees of freedom.</p></sec><sec id="section18-0956797611417632"><title>Using Bayesian statistics.</title><p>We have a similar reaction to calls for using Bayesian rather than frequentist approaches to analyzing experimental data (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797611417632">Wagenmakers, Wetzels, Borsboom, &amp; van der Maas, 2011</xref>). Although the Bayesian approach has many virtues, it actually increases researcher degrees of freedom. First, it offers a new set of analyses (in addition to all frequentist ones) that authors could flexibly try out on their data. Second, Bayesian statistics require making additional judgments (e.g., the prior distribution) on a case-by-case basis, providing yet more researcher degrees of freedom.</p></sec><sec id="section19-0956797611417632"><title>Conceptual replications</title><p>Because conceptual replications, in contrast to exact replications, do not bind researchers to make the same analytic decisions across studies, they are unfortunately misleading as a solution to the problem at hand. In an article with a conceptual replication, for instance, authors may choose two of three conditions in Study 1 and report one measure, but choose a different pair of conditions and a different measure in Study 2. Indeed, that is what we did in the experiments reported here.</p></sec><sec id="section20-0956797611417632"><title>Posting materials and data</title><p>We are strongly supportive of all journals requiring authors to make their original materials and data publicly available. However, this is not likely to address the problem of interest, as this policy would impose too high a cost on readers and reviewers to examine, in real time, the credibility of a particular claim. Readers should not need to download data, load it into their statistical packages, and start running analyses to learn the importance of controlling for father’s age; nor should they need to read pages of additional materials to learn that the researchers simply dropped the “Hot Potato” condition.</p><p>Furthermore, if a journal allows the redaction of a condition from the report, for example, it would presumably also allow its redaction from the raw data and “original” materials, making the entire transparency effort futile.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="section21-0956797611417632"><title>Concluding Remarks</title><p>Our goal as scientists is not to publish as many articles as we can, but to discover and disseminate truth. Many of us—and this includes the three authors of this article—often lose sight of this goal, yielding to the pressure to do whatever is justifiable to compile a set of studies that we can publish. This is not driven by a willingness to deceive but by the self-serving interpretation of ambiguity, which enables us to convince ourselves that whichever decisions produced the most publishable outcome must have also been the most appropriate. This article advocates a set of disclosure requirements that imposes minimal costs on authors, readers, and reviewers. These solutions will not rid researchers of publication pressures, but they will limit what authors are able to justify as acceptable to others and to themselves. We should embrace these disclosure requirements as if the credibility of our profession depended on them. Because it does.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>All three authors contributed equally to this article. Author order is alphabetical, controlling for father’s age (reverse-coded).
