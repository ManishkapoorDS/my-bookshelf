abstract: With machine learning successfully applied to new daunting problems almost
  every day, general AI starts looking like an attainable goal. However, most current
  research focuses instead on important but narrow applications, such as image classification
  or machine translation. We believe this to be largely due to the lack of objective
  ways to measure progress towards broad machine intelligence. In order to fill this
  gap, we propose here a set of concrete desiderata for general AI, together with
  a platform to test machines on how well they satisfy such desiderata, while keeping
  all further complexities to a minimum.
