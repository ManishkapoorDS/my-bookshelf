abstract: 'Learning goal-directed behavior in environments with sparse feedback is
  a major challenge for reinforcement learning algorithms. The primary difficulty
  arises due to insufficient exploration, resulting in an agent being unable to learn
  robust value functions. Intrinsically motivated agents can explore new behavior
  for its own sake rather than to directly solve problems. Such intrinsic behaviors
  could eventually help the agent solve tasks posed by the environment. We present
  hierarchical-DQN (h-DQN), a framework to integrate hierarchical value functions,
  operating at different temporal scales, with intrinsically motivated deep reinforcement
  learning. A top-level value function learns a policy over intrinsic goals, and a
  lower-level function learns a policy over atomic actions to satisfy the given goals.
  h-DQN allows for flexible goal specifications, such as functions over entities and
  relations. This provides an efficient space for exploration in complicated environments.
  We demonstrate the strength of our approach on two problems with very sparse, delayed
  feedback: (1) a complex discrete stochastic decision process, and (2) the classic
  ATARI game `Montezuma''s Revenge''.'
