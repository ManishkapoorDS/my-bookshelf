abstract: We consider partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with
  {\omega}-regular conditions specified as parity objectives. The class of {\omega}-regular
  languages extends regular languages to infinite strings and provides a robust specification
  language to express all properties used in verification, and parity objectives are
  canonical forms to express {\omega}-regular conditions. The qualitative analysis
  problem given a POMDP and a parity objective asks whether there is a strategy to
  ensure that the objective is satis- fied with probability 1 (resp. positive probability).
  While the qualitative analysis problems are known to be undecidable even for very
  special cases of parity objectives, we establish decidability (with optimal complexity)
  of the qualitative analysis problems for POMDPs with all parity objectives under
  finite- memory strategies. We establish optimal (exponential) memory bounds and
  EXPTIME-completeness of the qualitative analysis problems under finite-memory strategies
  for POMDPs with parity objectives.
