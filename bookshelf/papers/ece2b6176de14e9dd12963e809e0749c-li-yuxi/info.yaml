abstract: We give an overview of recent exciting achievements of deep reinforcement
  learning (RL). We discuss six core elements, six important mechanisms, and twelve
  applications. We start with background of machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement
  learning. Next we discuss core RL elements, including value function, in particular,
  Deep Q-Network (DQN), policy, reward, model, planning, and exploration. After that,
  we discuss important mechanisms for RL, including attention and memory, unsupervised
  learning, transfer learning, multi-agent RL, hierarchical RL, and learning to learn.
  Then we discuss various applications of RL, including games, in particular, AlphaGo,
  robotics, natural language processing, including dialogue systems, machine translation,
  and text generation, computer vision, neural architecture design, business management,
  finance, healthcare, Industry 4.0, smart grid, intelligent transportation systems,
  and computer systems. We mention topics not reviewed yet, and list a collection
  of RL resources. After presenting a brief summary, we close with discussions.   Please
  see Deep Reinforcement Learning, arXiv:1810.06339, for a significant update.
