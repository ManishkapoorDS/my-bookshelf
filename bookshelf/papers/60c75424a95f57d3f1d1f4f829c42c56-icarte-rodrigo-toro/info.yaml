abstract: 'Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents typically learn memoryless policies---policies
  that only consider the last observation when selecting actions. Learning memoryless
  policies is efficient and optimal in fully observable environments. However, some
  form of memory is necessary when RL agents are faced with partial observability.
  In this paper, we study a lightweight approach to tackle partial observability in
  RL. We provide the agent with an external memory and additional actions to control
  what, if anything, is written to the memory. At every step, the current memory state
  is part of the agent''s observation, and the agent selects a tuple of actions: one
  action that modifies the environment and another that modifies the memory. When
  the external memory is sufficiently expressive, optimal memoryless policies yield
  globally optimal solutions. Unfortunately, previous attempts to use external memory
  in the form of binary memory have produced poor results in practice. Here, we investigate
  alternative forms of memory in support of learning effective memoryless policies.
  Our novel forms of memory outperform binary and LSTM-based memory in well-established
  partially observable domains.'
