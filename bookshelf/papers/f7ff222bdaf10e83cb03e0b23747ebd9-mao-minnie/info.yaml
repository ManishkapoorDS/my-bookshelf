abstract: The road to becoming an astronomer is exciting, but often fraught with danger
  and conflicting messages. A PhD student is inundated with catch-phrases such as
  "publish or perish" and "it's not about the quantity, but the quality of work".
  How do we know which advice to follow? How can we publish copious amounts of quality
  work in only three years so as to maximize our success in the future? How do we
  even know what "good quality" really is? With only a short time to prepare ourselves
  for the big wide world of Astronomy, what is the best way for a PhD student to maximize
  their research and ultimately maximize their success as a real astronomer? The PhD
  students of today are the astronomers of tomorrow, but their journey depends on
  a positive work environment in which they can thrive and improve. Here I present
  the results of a survey of current PhD students on how they believe they can maximize
  their success in science. I find that PhD students in Australia expect to write
  more papers during their PhD than is expected by their supervisors, but that they
  are generally happy with the quality of their supervision. Above all, students love
  telescopes, and hands-on observations are an important part of acquiring the knowledge
  and culture necessary to becoming a real astronomer.
