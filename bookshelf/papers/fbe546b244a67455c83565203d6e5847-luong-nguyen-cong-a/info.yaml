abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on applications of
  deep reinforcement learning in communications and networking. Modern networks, e.g.,
  Internet of Things (IoT) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks, become more
  decentralized and autonomous. In such networks, network entities need to make decisions
  locally to maximize the network performance under uncertainty of network environment.
  Reinforcement learning has been efficiently used to enable the network entities
  to obtain the optimal policy including, e.g., decisions or actions, given their
  states when the state and action spaces are small. However, in complex and large-scale
  networks, the state and action spaces are usually large, and the reinforcement learning
  may not be able to find the optimal policy in reasonable time. Therefore, deep reinforcement
  learning, a combination of reinforcement learning with deep learning, has been developed
  to overcome the shortcomings. In this survey, we first give a tutorial of deep reinforcement
  learning from fundamental concepts to advanced models. Then, we review deep reinforcement
  learning approaches proposed to address emerging issues in communications and networking.
  The issues include dynamic network access, data rate control, wireless caching,
  data offloading, network security, and connectivity preservation which are all important
  to next generation networks such as 5G and beyond. Furthermore, we present applications
  of deep reinforcement learning for traffic routing, resource sharing, and data collection.
  Finally, we highlight important challenges, open issues, and future research directions
  of applying deep reinforcement learning.
