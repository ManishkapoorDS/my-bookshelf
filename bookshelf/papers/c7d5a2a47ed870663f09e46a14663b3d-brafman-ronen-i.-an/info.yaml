abstract: <jats:p>In this paper, we investigate non-Markovian Nondeterministic Fully
  Observable Planning Domains (NMFONDs), variants of Nondeterministic Fully Observable
  Planning Domains (FONDs) where the next state is determined by the full history
  leading to the current state.  In particular, we introduce TFONDs which are NMFONDs
  where conditions on the history are succinctly and declaratively specified using
  the linear-time temporal logic on finite traces LTLf and its extension LDLf.  We
  provide algorithms for planning in TFONDs for general LTLf/LDLf goals, and establish
  tight complexity bounds w.r.t. the domain representation and the goal, separately.
  We also show that TFONDs are able to capture all NMFONDs in which the dependency
  on the history is "finite state". Finally, we show that TFONDs also capture  Partially
  Observable Nondeterministic Planning Domains (PONDs), but without referring to unobservable
  variables.</jats:p>
