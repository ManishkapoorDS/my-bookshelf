abstract: <jats:p>Much work in automatic verification considers families of similar
  finite-state systems. But an often overlooked property is that sometimes a single
  finite-state system can be used to describe a parameterized, infinite family of
  systems. Thus verification of unbounded state spaces can take place by reduction
  to finite ones.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The purpose of this article is to introduce
  Monadic Second-order Logic as a practical means of carrying out such reductions.
  The logic is a highly succinct alternative to the use of regular expressions. We
  have built a tool that acts as a decision procedure and translator to DFAs.&lt;br
  /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The potential applications are numerous. We discuss text processing,
  Boolean circuits, and distributed systems. Our main example is an automatic proof
  of properties for the ``Dining Philosophers with Encyclopedia'' example by Kurshan
  and MacMillan. We establish these properties for the parameterized case &lt;em&gt;
  without&lt;/em&gt; the use of induction.</jats:p>
