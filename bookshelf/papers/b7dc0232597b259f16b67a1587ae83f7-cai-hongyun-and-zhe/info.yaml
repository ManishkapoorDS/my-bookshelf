abstract: Graph is an important data representation which appears in a wide diversity
  of real-world scenarios. Effective graph analytics provides users a deeper understanding
  of what is behind the data, and thus can benefit a lot of useful applications such
  as node classification, node recommendation, link prediction, etc. However, most
  graph analytics methods suffer the high computation and space cost. Graph embedding
  is an effective yet efficient way to solve the graph analytics problem. It converts
  the graph data into a low dimensional space in which the graph structural information
  and graph properties are maximally preserved. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive
  review of the literature in graph embedding. We first introduce the formal definition
  of graph embedding as well as the related concepts. After that, we propose two taxonomies
  of graph embedding which correspond to what challenges exist in different graph
  embedding problem settings and how the existing work address these challenges in
  their solutions. Finally, we summarize the applications that graph embedding enables
  and suggest four promising future research directions in terms of computation efficiency,
  problem settings, techniques and application scenarios.
