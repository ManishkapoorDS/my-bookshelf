abstract: Interactions between agents are usually designed from a global viewpoint.
  However, the implementation of a multi-agent interaction is distributed. This difference
  can introduce issues. For instance, it is possible to specify protocols from a global
  viewpoint that cannot be implemented as a collection of individual agents. This
  leads naturally to the question of whether a given (global) protocol is enactable.
  We consider this question in a powerful setting (trace expression), considering
  a range of message ordering interpretations (what does it mean to say that an interaction
  step occurs before another), and a range of possible constraints on the semantics
  of message delivery, corresponding to different properties of underlying communication
  middleware.
