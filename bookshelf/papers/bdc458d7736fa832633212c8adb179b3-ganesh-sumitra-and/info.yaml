abstract: Market makers play an important role in providing liquidity to markets by
  continuously quoting prices at which they are willing to buy and sell, and managing
  inventory risk. In this paper, we build a multi-agent simulation of a dealer market
  and demonstrate that it can be used to understand the behavior of a reinforcement
  learning (RL) based market maker agent. We use the simulator to train an RL-based
  market maker agent with different competitive scenarios, reward formulations and
  market price trends (drifts). We show that the reinforcement learning agent is able
  to learn about its competitor's pricing policy; it also learns to manage inventory
  by smartly selecting asymmetric prices on the buy and sell sides (skewing), and
  maintaining a positive (or negative) inventory depending on whether the market price
  drift is positive (or negative). Finally, we propose and test reward formulations
  for creating risk averse RL-based market maker agents.
