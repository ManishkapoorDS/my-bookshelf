abstract: In recent years, non-monotonic Inductive Logic Programming has received
  growing interest. Specifically, several new learning frameworks and algorithms have
  been introduced for learning under the answer set semantics, allowing the learning
  of common-sense knowledge involving defaults and exceptions, which are essential
  aspects of human reasoning. In this paper, we present a noise-tolerant generalisation
  of the learning from answer sets framework. We evaluate our ILASP3 system, both
  on synthetic and on real datasets, represented in the new framework. In particular,
  we show that on many of the datasets ILASP3 achieves a higher accuracy than other
  ILP systems that have previously been applied to the datasets, including a recently
  proposed differentiable learning framework.
