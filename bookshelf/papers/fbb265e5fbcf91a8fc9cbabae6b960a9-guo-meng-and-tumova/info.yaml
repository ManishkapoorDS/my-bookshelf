abstract: We propose a framework for the decentralized control of a team of agents
  that are assigned local tasks expressed as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas.
  Each local LTL task specification captures both the requirements on the respective
  agent's behavior and the requests for the other agents' collaborations needed to
  accomplish the task. Furthermore, the agents are subject to communication constraints.
  The presented solution follows the automata-theoretic approach to LTL model checking,
  however, it avoids the computationally demanding construction of synchronized product
  system between the agents. We suggest a decentralized coordination among the agents
  through a dynamic leader-follower scheme, to guarantee the low-level connectivity
  maintenance at all times and a progress towards the satisfaction of the leader's
  task. By a systematic leader switching, we ensure that each agent's task will be
  accomplished.
