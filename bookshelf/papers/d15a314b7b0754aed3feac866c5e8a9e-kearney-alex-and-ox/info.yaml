abstract: Within Reinforcement Learning, there is a fledgling approach to conceptualizing
  the environment in terms of predictions. Central to this predictive approach is
  the assertion that it is possible to construct ontologies in terms of predictions
  about sensation, behaviour, and time---to categorize the world into entities which
  express all aspects of the world using only predictions. This construction of ontologies
  is integral to predictive approaches to machine knowledge where objects are described
  exclusively in terms of how they are perceived. In this paper, we ground the Pericean
  model of semiotics in terms of Reinforcement Learning Methods, describing Peirce's
  Three Categories in the notation of General Value Functions. Using the Peircean
  model of semiotics, we demonstrate that predictions alone are insufficient to construct
  an ontology; however, we identify predictions as being integral to the meaning-making
  process. Moreover, we discuss how predictive knowledge provides a particularly stable
  foundation for semiosis\textemdash the process of making meaning\textemdash and
  suggest a possible avenue of research to design algorithmic methods which construct
  semantics and meaning using predictions.
