abstract: We marry ideas from deep neural networks and approximate Bayesian inference
  to derive a generalised class of deep, directed generative models, endowed with
  a new algorithm for scalable inference and learning. Our algorithm introduces a
  recognition model to represent approximate posterior distributions, and that acts
  as a stochastic encoder of the data. We develop stochastic back-propagation -- rules
  for back-propagation through stochastic variables -- and use this to develop an
  algorithm that allows for joint optimisation of the parameters of both the generative
  and recognition model. We demonstrate on several real-world data sets that the model
  generates realistic samples, provides accurate imputations of missing data and is
  a useful tool for high-dimensional data visualisation.
