abstract: Automatic differentiation---the mechanical transformation of numeric computer
  programs to calculate derivatives efficiently and accurately---dates to the origin
  of the computer age. Reverse mode automatic differentiation both antedates and generalizes
  the method of backwards propagation of errors used in machine learning. Despite
  this, practitioners in a variety of fields, including machine learning, have been
  little influenced by automatic differentiation, and make scant use of available
  tools. Here we review the technique of automatic differentiation, describe its two
  main modes, and explain how it can benefit machine learning practitioners. To reach
  the widest possible audience our treatment assumes only elementary differential
  calculus, and does not assume any knowledge of linear algebra.
