abstract: We present the language {m P}{cal C}+ for probabilistic reasoning about
  actions, which is a generalization of the action language {cal C}+ that allows to
  deal with probabilistic as well as nondeterministic effects of actions. We define
  a formal semantics of {m P}{cal C}+ in terms of probabilistic transitions between
  sets of states. Using a concept of a history and its belief state, we then show
  how several important problems in reasoning about actions can be concisely formulated
  in our formalism.
