abstract: Much of current machine learning (ML) research has lost its connection to
  problems of import to the larger world of science and society. From this perspective,
  there exist glaring limitations in the data sets we investigate, the metrics we
  employ for evaluation, and the degree to which results are communicated back to
  their originating domains. What changes are needed to how we conduct research to
  increase the impact that ML has? We present six Impact Challenges to explicitly
  focus the field?s energy and attention, and we discuss existing obstacles that must
  be addressed. We aim to inspire ongoing discussion and focus on ML that matters.
