abstract: <jats:p>Multiagent systems (MAS) are widely accepted as an important method
  for solving problems of a distributed nature. A key to the success of MAS is efficient
  and effective multiagent learning (MAL). The past twenty-five years have seen a
  great interest and tremendous progress in the field of MAL. This article introduces
  and overviews this field by presenting its fundamentals, sketching its historical
  development and describing some key algorithms for MAL. Moreover, main challenges
  that the field is facing today are indentified.</jats:p>
