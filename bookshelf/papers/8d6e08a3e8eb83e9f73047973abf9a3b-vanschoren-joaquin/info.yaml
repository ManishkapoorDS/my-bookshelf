abstract: Meta-learning, or learning to learn, is the science of systematically observing
  how different machine learning approaches perform on a wide range of learning tasks,
  and then learning from this experience, or meta-data, to learn new tasks much faster
  than otherwise possible. Not only does this dramatically speed up and improve the
  design of machine learning pipelines or neural architectures, it also allows us
  to replace hand-engineered algorithms with novel approaches learned in a data-driven
  way. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the state of the art in this fascinating
  and continuously evolving field.
