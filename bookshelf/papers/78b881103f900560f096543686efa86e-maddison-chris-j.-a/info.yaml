abstract: The game of Go is more challenging than other board games, due to the difficulty
  of constructing a position or move evaluation function. In this paper we investigate
  whether deep convolutional networks can be used to directly represent and learn
  this knowledge. We train a large 12-layer convolutional neural network by supervised
  learning from a database of human professional games. The network correctly predicts
  the expert move in 55% of positions, equalling the accuracy of a 6 dan human player.
  When the trained convolutional network was used directly to play games of Go, without
  any search, it beat the traditional search program GnuGo in 97% of games, and matched
  the performance of a state-of-the-art Monte-Carlo tree search that simulates a million
  positions per move.
