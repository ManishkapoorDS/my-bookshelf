abstract: Lots of learning tasks require dealing with graph data which contains rich
  relation information among elements. Modeling physics system, learning molecular
  fingerprints, predicting protein interface, and classifying diseases require a model
  to learn from graph inputs. In other domains such as learning from non-structural
  data like texts and images, reasoning on extracted structures, like the dependency
  tree of sentences and the scene graph of images, is an important research topic
  which also needs graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are connectionist
  models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes
  of graphs. Unlike standard neural networks, graph neural networks retain a state
  that can represent information from its neighborhood with arbitrary depth. Although
  the primitive GNNs have been found difficult to train for a fixed point, recent
  advances in network architectures, optimization techniques, and parallel computation
  have enabled successful learning with them. In recent years, systems based on variants
  of graph neural networks such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention
  network (GAT), gated graph neural network (GGNN) have demonstrated ground-breaking
  performance on many tasks mentioned above. In this survey, we provide a detailed
  review over existing graph neural network models, systematically categorize the
  applications, and propose four open problems for future research.
