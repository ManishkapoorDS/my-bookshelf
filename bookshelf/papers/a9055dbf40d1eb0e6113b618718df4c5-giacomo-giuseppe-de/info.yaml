abstract: Runtime monitoring is one of the central tasks to provide operational decision
  support to running business processes, and check on-the-fly whether they comply
  with constraints and rules. We study runtime monitoring of properties expressed
  in LTL on finite traces (LTLf) and in its extension LDLf. LDLf is a powerful logic
  that captures all monadic second order logic on finite traces, which is obtained
  by combining regular expressions and LTLf, adopting the syntax of propositional
  dynamic logic (PDL). Interestingly, in spite of its greater expressivity, LDLf has
  exactly the same computational complexity of LTLf. We show that LDLf is able to
  capture, in the logic itself, not only the constraints to be monitored, but also
  the de-facto standard RV-LTL monitors. This makes it possible to declaratively capture
  monitoring metaconstraints, and check them by relying on usual logical services
  instead of ad-hoc algorithms. This, in turn, enables to flexibly monitor constraints
  depending on the monitoring state of other constraints, e.g., "compensation" constraints
  that are only checked when others are detected to be violated. In addition, we devise
  a direct translation of LDLf formulas into nondeterministic automata, avoiding to
  detour to Buechi automata or alternating automata, and we use it to implement a
  monitoring plug-in for the PROM suite.
