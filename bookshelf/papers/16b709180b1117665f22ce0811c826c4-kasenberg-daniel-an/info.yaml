abstract: 'Recent work has addressed using formulas in linear temporal logic (LTL)
  as specifications for agents planning in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We consider
  the inverse problem: inferring an LTL specification from demonstrated behavior trajectories
  in MDPs. We formulate this as a multiobjective optimization problem, and describe
  state-based ("what actually happened") and action-based ("what the agent expected
  to happen") objective functions based on a notion of "violation cost". We demonstrate
  the efficacy of the approach by employing genetic programming to solve this problem
  in two simple domains.'
