abstract: This paper collects and extends the lectures I gave at the "XXIV International
  Fall Workshop on Geometry and Physics" held in Zaragoza (Spain) August 31 - September
  4, 2015. Within these lectures I review the formulation of Quantum Mechanics, and
  quantum theories in general, from a mathematically advanced viewpoint, essentially
  based on the orthomodular lattice of elementary propositions, discussing some fundamental
  ideas, mathematical tools and theorems also related to the representation of physical
  symmetries. The final step consists of an elementary introduction the so-called
  (C*-) algebraic formulation of quantum theories.
