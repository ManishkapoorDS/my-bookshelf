abstract: This paper studies few-shot learning via representation learning, where
  one uses $T$ source tasks with $n_1$ data per task to learn a representation in
  order to reduce the sample complexity of a target task for which there is only $n_2
  (\ll n_1)$ data. Specifically, we focus on the setting where there exists a good
  \emph{common representation} between source and target, and our goal is to understand
  how much of a sample size reduction is possible. First, we study the setting where
  this common representation is low-dimensional and provide a fast rate of $O\left(\frac{\mathcal{C}\left(\Phi\right)}{n_1T}
  + \frac{k}{n_2}\right)$; here, $\Phi$ is the representation function class, $\mathcal{C}\left(\Phi\right)$
  is its complexity measure, and $k$ is the dimension of the representation. When
  specialized to linear representation functions, this rate becomes $O\left(\frac{dk}{n_1T}
  + \frac{k}{n_2}\right)$ where $d (\gg k)$ is the ambient input dimension, which
  is a substantial improvement over the rate without using representation learning,
  i.e. over the rate of $O\left(\frac{d}{n_2}\right)$. Second, we consider the setting
  where the common representation may be high-dimensional but is capacity-constrained
  (say in norm); here, we again demonstrate the advantage of representation learning
  in both high-dimensional linear regression and neural network learning. Our results
  demonstrate representation learning can fully utilize all $n_1T$ samples from source
  tasks.
