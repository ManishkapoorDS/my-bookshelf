abstract: 'We introduce Symbolic Alternating Finite Automata (s-AFA) as an expressive,
  succinct, and decidable model for describing sets of finite sequences over arbitrary
  alphabets. Boolean operations over s-AFAs have linear complexity, which is in sharp
  contrast with the quadratic cost of intersection and union for non-alternating symbolic
  automata. Due to this succinctness, emptiness and equivalence checking are PSpace-hard.   We
  introduce an algorithm for checking the equivalence of two s-AFAs based on bisimulation
  up to congruence. This algorithm allows us to exploit the power of SAT and SMT solvers
  to efficiently search the state space of the s-AFAs. We evaluate our decision procedure
  on two verification and security applications: 1) checking satisfiability of linear
  temporal logic formulas over finite traces, and 2) checking equivalence of Boolean
  combinations of regular expressions. Our experiments show that our technique often
  outperforms existing techniques and it can be beneficial in both such applications.'
