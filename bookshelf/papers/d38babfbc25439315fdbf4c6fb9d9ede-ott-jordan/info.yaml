abstract: Artificial Intelligence has historically relied on planning, heuristics,
  and handcrafted approaches designed by experts. All the while claiming to pursue
  the creation of Intelligence. This approach fails to acknowledge that intelligence
  emerges from the dynamics within a complex system. Neurons in the brain are governed
  by local rules, where no single neuron, or group of neurons, coordinates or controls
  the others. This local structure gives rise to the appropriate dynamics in which
  intelligence can emerge. Populations of neurons must compete with their neighbors
  for resources, inhibition, and activity representation. At the same time, they must
  cooperate, so the population and organism can perform high-level functions. To this
  end, we introduce modeling neurons as reinforcement learning agents. Where each
  neuron may be viewed as an independent actor, trying to maximize its own self-interest.
  By framing learning in this way, we open the door to an entirely new approach to
  building intelligent systems.
