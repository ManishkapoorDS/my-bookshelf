abstract: "<jats:p>The paper considers the consequences of competition between two\
  \ widely used exchange mechanisms, a  \t\x93decentralized bargaining'' market, and\
  \ a  \t\x93centralized'' market. In every period, members of a large heterogenous\
  \ group of privately-informed traders who each wish to buy or sell one unit of some\
  \ homogenous good may opt for trading through one exchange mechanism. Traders may\
  \ also postpone their trade to a future period. It is shown that trade outside the\
  \ centralized market completely unravels. In every strong Nash equilibrium, all\
  \ trade takes place in the centralized market. No trade ever occurs through direct\
  \ negotiations.</jats:p>"
