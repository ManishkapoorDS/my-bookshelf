abstract: We introduce DeepProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language that
  incorporates deep learning by means of neural predicates. We show how existing inference
  and learning techniques can be adapted for the new language. Our experiments demonstrate
  that DeepProbLog supports both symbolic and subsymbolic representations and inference,
  1) program induction, 2) probabilistic (logic) programming, and 3) (deep) learning
  from examples. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to propose a
  framework where general-purpose neural networks and expressive probabilistic-logical
  modeling and reasoning are integrated in a way that exploits the full expressiveness
  and strengths of both worlds and can be trained end-to-end based on examples.
