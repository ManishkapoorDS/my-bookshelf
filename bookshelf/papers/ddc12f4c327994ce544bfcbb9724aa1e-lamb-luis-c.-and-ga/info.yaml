abstract: Neural-symbolic computing has now become the subject of interest of both
  academic and industry research laboratories. Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been
  widely used in relational and symbolic domains, with widespread application of GNNs
  in combinatorial optimization, constraint satisfaction, relational reasoning and
  other scientific domains. The need for improved explainability, interpretability
  and trust of AI systems in general demands principled methodologies, as suggested
  by neural-symbolic computing. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art on the
  use of GNNs as a model of neural-symbolic computing. This includes the application
  of GNNs in several domains as well as its relationship to current developments in
  neural-symbolic computing.
