abstract: This paper is concerned with a class of algorithms that perform exhaustive
  search on propositional knowledge bases. We show that each of these algorithms defines
  and generates a propositional language. Specifically, we show that the trace of
  a search can be interpreted as a combinational circuit, and a search algorithm then
  defines a propositional language consisting of circuits that are generated across
  all possible executions of the algorithm. In particular, we show that several versions
  of exhaustive DPLL search correspond to such well-known languages as FBDD, OBDD,
  and a precisely-defined subset of d-DNNF. By thus mapping search algorithms to propositional
  languages, we provide a uniform and practical framework in which successful search
  techniques can be harnessed for compilation of knowledge into various languages
  of interest, and a new methodology whereby the power and limitations of search algorithms
  can be understood by looking up the tractability and succinctness of the corresponding
  propositional languages.
