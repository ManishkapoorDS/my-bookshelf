abstract: The binary similarity problem consists in determining if two functions are
  similar by only considering their compiled form. Advanced techniques for binary
  similarity recently gained momentum as they can be applied in several fields, such
  as copyright disputes, malware analysis, vulnerability detection, etc., and thus
  have an immediate practical impact. Current solutions compare functions by first
  transforming their binary code in multi-dimensional vector representations (embeddings),
  and then comparing vectors through simple and efficient geometric operations. However,
  embeddings are usually derived from binary code using manual feature extraction,
  that may fail in considering important function characteristics, or may consider
  features that are not important for the binary similarity problem. In this paper
  we propose SAFE, a novel architecture for the embedding of functions based on a
  self-attentive neural network. SAFE works directly on disassembled binary functions,
  does not require manual feature extraction, is computationally more efficient than
  existing solutions (i.e., it does not incur in the computational overhead of building
  or manipulating control flow graphs), and is more general as it works on stripped
  binaries and on multiple architectures. We report the results from a quantitative
  and qualitative analysis that show how SAFE provides a noticeable performance improvement
  with respect to previous solutions. Furthermore, we show how clusters of our embedding
  vectors are closely related to the semantic of the implemented algorithms, paving
  the way for further interesting applications (e.g. semantic-based binary function
  search).
