abstract: With the recent wave of progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has come
  a growing awareness of the large-scale impacts of AI systems, and recognition that
  existing regulations and norms in industry and academia are insufficient to ensure
  responsible AI development. In order for AI developers to earn trust from system
  users, customers, civil society, governments, and other stakeholders that they are
  building AI responsibly, they will need to make verifiable claims to which they
  can be held accountable. Those outside of a given organization also need effective
  means of scrutinizing such claims. This report suggests various steps that different
  stakeholders can take to improve the verifiability of claims made about AI systems
  and their associated development processes, with a focus on providing evidence about
  the safety, security, fairness, and privacy protection of AI systems. We analyze
  ten mechanisms for this purpose--spanning institutions, software, and hardware--and
  make recommendations aimed at implementing, exploring, or improving those mechanisms.
