abstract: 'Probabilistic omega-automata are variants of nondeterministic automata
  for infinite words where all choices are resolved by probabilistic distributions.
  Acceptance of an infinite input word can be defined in different ways: by requiring
  that (i) the probability for the accepting runs is positive (probable semantics),
  or (ii) almost all runs are accepting (almost-sure semantics), or (iii) the probability
  measure of the accepting runs is greater than a certain threshold (threshold semantics).
  The underlying notion of an accepting run can be defined as for standard omega-automata
  by means of a Buechi condition or other acceptance conditions, e.g., Rabin or Streett
  conditions. In this paper, we put the main focus on the probable semantics and provide
  a summary of the fundamental properties of probabilistic omega-automata concerning
  expressiveness, efficiency, and decision problems.'
