abstract: While machine learning and artificial intelligence have long been applied
  in networking research, the bulk of such works has focused on supervised learning.
  Recently there has been a rising trend of employing unsupervised machine learning
  using unstructured raw network data to improve network performance and provide services
  such as traffic engineering, anomaly detection, Internet traffic classification,
  and quality of service optimization. The interest in applying unsupervised learning
  techniques in networking emerges from their great success in other fields such as
  computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and optimal control
  (e.g., for developing autonomous self-driving cars). Unsupervised learning is interesting
  since it can unconstrain us from the need of labeled data and manual handcrafted
  feature engineering thereby facilitating flexible, general, and automated methods
  of machine learning. The focus of this survey paper is to provide an overview of
  the applications of unsupervised learning in the domain of networking. We provide
  a comprehensive survey highlighting the recent advancements in unsupervised learning
  techniques and describe their applications for various learning tasks in the context
  of networking. We also provide a discussion on future directions and open research
  issues, while also identifying potential pitfalls. While a few survey papers focusing
  on the applications of machine learning in networking have previously been published,
  a survey of similar scope and breadth is missing in literature. Through this paper,
  we advance the state of knowledge by carefully synthesizing the insights from these
  survey papers while also providing contemporary coverage of recent advances.
